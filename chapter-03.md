# Chapter 3: First Day on the Job

Monday morning I'm awake before Frank knocks on my door. Years of moving from place to place have trained me to sleep light and wake early.

I'm dressed and in the kitchen by five-thirty, coffee already brewing. Frank comes out at quarter to six, nods approval at the full pot, and pours us both cups.

"Site's on the east side of town," he says. "New medical building going up next to Doc Harrison's practice. Foundation's done, we're framing this week. You ride with me or take your truck?"

"I'll follow you. In case I need to leave early or anything."

Frank gives me a look that suggests he knows what I mean—in case I need my escape vehicle close—but he doesn't comment. Just drinks his coffee and sets his mug in the sink.

"Let's go."

The construction site is fifteen minutes away, down a dirt road that turns off main street. The skeleton of a building rises against the morning sky—concrete foundation, wooden framing already started. A couple of trucks are parked nearby, and three men stand drinking coffee from thermoses, their breath visible in the cool mountain air.

Frank pulls in and I park beside him. The men look over, curious but not unfriendly.

"Morning, Frank," one of them calls. Older guy, maybe fifty, with a substantial gut and a weathered face.

"Morning, Pete. Boys, this is my nephew Jesse. He'll be working with us through the summer." Frank gestures to each man in turn. "Pete Summers, Mike Bradley, Danny Pritchard."

Pete and Mike nod at me, assessing. Danny—a guy about my age with sandy hair and an easy grin—steps forward and sticks out his hand.

"Jesse, good to meet you. You know your way around a construction site?"

"I've worked a few."

"Good enough. We can always use another set of hands." Danny's handshake is firm, friendly. "You just get into town?"

"Saturday."

"Welcome to Silver Ridge. It's not much, but it's home."

There's no edge to his voice, no suspicion. Just genuine welcome, the kind I'm not used to getting from locals. Most places I'm the stranger who needs to prove himself before anyone bothers being friendly. Danny acts like we've known each other longer than thirty seconds.

"All right," Frank says, cutting through the small talk. "Let's get to work. We're framing the north wall today. Jesse, you're with Danny and Mike. Pete, you're with me on the interior supports."

We grab our tool belts and gloves from the trucks. Mine's worn smooth from two years of different job sites. Danny's looks newer, well-maintained.

"So you've done framing before?" Danny asks as we walk toward the building.

"Yeah. Last job was roofing in Montana. Done plenty of framing in Oregon, California, Arizona."

"Man, you've been all over." Danny picks up a bundle of two-by-fours and I grab another. "What's that like, just moving around?"

"It's all right."

"I've lived here my whole life. Never been farther than Denver." He doesn't sound resentful, just matter-of-fact. "My girlfriend wants to travel someday. See the ocean. I keep telling her we will, after I take over my dad's hardware store."

We set the lumber down where Mike's waiting with the nail gun. The morning is cool but I'm already warming up from the work, the familiar rhythm of measuring, cutting, lifting. This is something I'm good at. Physical work with clear results—you frame a wall, you can see what you've accomplished.

"You got a girl back home somewhere?" Danny asks as we measure the next board.

"No."

"Smart. Harder to move around if you're tied down, right?"

I glance at him to see if he's judging, but he's just curious, friendly. No agenda.

"Something like that."

We work steadily through the morning. Danny talks enough for both of us, which suits me fine. He tells me about Silver Ridge—who lives where, what businesses are worth frequenting. He mentions the diner has the best pie in Colorado, the lake twenty miles north is good for fishing, that everyone goes to the summer festival in August.

I listen more than I talk, learning the landscape of this place I'll call home for three months.

Mike's quieter, older than Danny and me by maybe ten years. He works with practiced efficiency, not wasting motion. When he does speak, it's usually to point out a measurement or ask for a tool. I respect that. Not everyone needs to fill silence with words.

At noon Frank calls lunch break. We gather in the shade of the building, sitting on stacks of lumber or leaning against the trucks. Danny produces a lunch pail with sandwiches and an apple. Mike has the same. Frank pulls out a brown bag. I've got the sandwich I made this morning at Frank's kitchen counter.

"So how long you staying in Silver Ridge?" Danny asks, biting into his sandwich.

This is the question I've been expecting. The one that always comes eventually.

"Just the summer. I'll move on in September."

Danny nods, considering. "That's too bad. Frank could use good help year-round. Construction doesn't stop just because summer ends."

"I don't usually stay places long."

"Why not?" Not challenging, just curious.

I shrug. "Just how I do things. Keep moving, see different places, don't get too settled."

"Huh." Danny takes another bite, chews thoughtfully. "Well, you seem like good people. Silver Ridge could use more good people."

The casual acceptance in his voice catches me off guard. He's not trying to convince me to stay, not judging me for leaving, just stating what he sees as fact. Like being a drifter doesn't automatically make me suspicious or unreliable. Like I could be good people and still be temporary.

I don't know how to respond to that, so I just nod and eat my sandwich.

"You meet Harper yet?" Danny asks after a minute. "Harper Wells, the Reverend's daughter?"

"Yeah. Yesterday at church."

"She's great. My Carol Ann's best friend. They've been thick as thieves since grade school." Danny grins. "Harper runs those youth programs at the community center. Frank said you'd be helping out with that?"

"Couple afternoons a week."

"Good luck." Danny laughs. "Those kids are wild. But Harper keeps them in line somehow. She's good with people."

I remember her genuine smile, the way she asked if I liked traveling instead of just where I'd been. The warmth in her eyes that made me want to answer honestly instead of deflecting.

"She seems nice."

"She's one of the best people in this town," Danny says with the certainty of someone who's known her his whole life. "You treat her right, Jesse. Her dad's protective, and the whole town looks out for her."

There's no threat in his voice, but the message is clear: Harper matters to Silver Ridge, and they'll notice if I do anything to hurt her.

"I'm just helping out at the center. That's all."

"I know, I know." Danny holds up his hands, grinning. "Just making sure we're clear. Can't be too careful with strangers, you know?"

But he says it with such good humor that I can't take offense. He's looking out for someone he cares about. I'd do the same in his position.

We finish lunch and get back to work. The afternoon is warmer, sun beating down on the exposed site. Sweat soaks through my shirt and my hands blister from gripping tools, but it's the good kind of tired that comes from honest work. The wall takes shape board by board, solid and square.

Frank comes by around two to check our progress. He examines the framing with a critical eye, testing joints, checking levels. After a minute he nods.

"Good work. Keep this pace, we'll have the north wall done by end of day tomorrow."

It's not effusive praise, but coming from Frank it feels significant. He's not a man who gives compliments lightly.

The crew breaks up at three like Frank promised, when the afternoon heat becomes oppressive. Mike and Pete pack up and head out with brief goodbyes. Danny lingers, coiling extension cords.

"You want to grab a beer sometime?" he asks. "There's a place on main street, nothing fancy, but it's where folks go after work."

The invitation surprises me. "Maybe. I'll see."

"Sure, sure. No pressure." Danny throws the cord in his truck bed. "But if you change your mind, I'm usually there Thursday nights. Standing invitation."

"Thanks."

He drives off with a wave, leaving me and Frank to load the last of the tools. We work in companionable silence, the easy rhythm of two people who don't need conversation to fill space.

"You did good today," Frank says as we're finishing up. "You know what you're doing."

"I've had practice."

"More than just practice. You've got a feel for it." He closes his truck bed, turns to look at me directly. "There's permanent work here if you wanted it. Not just this job—there's always construction in Silver Ridge. Houses, repairs, expansions. Pete and Mike have been with me fifteen years. I could use another hand year-round."

The offer hangs in the air between us. Permanent work. A steady job in one place. The kind of thing I haven't had since I left home two years ago.

The kind of thing that means staying.

"I appreciate that," I say carefully. "But I'm still planning to leave in September."

Frank nods slowly, like he expected that answer but had to make the offer anyway.

"Door's open if you change your mind."

"Thank you."

We drive back to his house separately, my truck following his down the dirt road to town. The sun's lower now, casting long shadows across the mountains. Through the windshield I can see Silver Ridge spread out below—small, contained, permanent.

A place where people like Danny and Mike and Pete work the same job for fifteen years. Where Frank makes offers of permanent employment. Where doors stay open for those who want to walk through them.

I tighten my grip on the steering wheel and remind myself: three months, then gone.

But that night after dinner, lying in the spare room with my muscles pleasantly sore from good work, I think about Danny's easy friendship and Frank's quiet approval. About being called "good people" by someone who just met me, about offers of permanence I'm not ready to accept.

About the fact that for the first time in a long time, being temporary feels less comfortable than it used to.

I close my eyes and picture my truck pointing south, highway stretching ahead, the open road calling. The image that usually brings comfort feels hollow tonight.

Maybe I'm just tired.

Maybe it's nothing.

I fall asleep trying to convince myself it's nothing.
