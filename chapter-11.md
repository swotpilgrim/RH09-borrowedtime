# Chapter 11: July Heat

Mid-July brings heat that makes the morning construction work brutal and the afternoon community center sessions feel like working in an oven. The kids are restless with summer energy, and Harper moves the programs outside as much as possible, using the shade trees and the small swimming pool the community center opens in summer.

But the heat's not the only thing that's intensified.

The town has noticed me and Harper.

I realize it walking down main street one afternoon. Mrs. Henderson from the five and dime watches us pass, her expression somewhere between approval and concern. At the diner, conversations pause when we walk in together, resume in lower voices after we're seated. Even Danny's stopped making jokes about it, his expression more serious when he mentions seeing us around town.

"People talk," he says one day at the construction site. "Not meanly, just... they talk. You know how small towns are."

"What are they saying?"

"That the minister's daughter is spending a lot of time with Frank Carter's nephew. That you're leaving in September. That Reverend Wells isn't happy about it." Danny wipes sweat from his forehead. "Just be careful, man. Harper's reputation matters here."

The warning settles uneasily. I hadn't thought about how spending time with me might affect Harper in a town where everyone knows everyone's business. She's the good girl, the minister's daughter. I'm the drifter passing through.

That afternoon at the community center, Frank shows up. He usually doesn't come by during programs, so his presence means something.

"Jesse, got a minute?"

We step outside while Harper manages the kids.

"Reverend Wells came by the job site today," Frank says without preamble. "Asked about your plans. Specifically, when you're leaving."

My stomach tightens. "What did you tell him?"

"That you'd said September. That you've been good help and I'd offered you permanent work if you wanted it." Frank looks at me steadily. "He asked if you'd accepted. I said you hadn't."

"I haven't decided."

"I know. But Jesse—Reverend's protective of his daughter. Whole town is. They see you two together, they're going to have opinions."

"We're just friends."

Frank gives me a look that says he knows better. "You're eighteen. She's seventeen. You're not 'just friends' and everyone can see it. Question is what you're going to do about it."

"I don't know."

"Well, you better figure it out. Because if you're leaving in six weeks, you need to start pulling back now. And if you're staying, you need to make that clear." He pauses. "Can't have it both ways."

He leaves, and I'm left standing outside the community center, the weight of his words pressing down. He's right—I can't keep spending time with Harper, letting feelings develop, without making a decision about staying or going.

The problem is, I still don't know which decision to make.

Inside, Harper's leading a craft project. I watch through the window—her patience, her warmth, how every kid wants her attention because she makes them feel special. She glances up, sees me watching, smiles.

That smile makes my chest ache.

That evening Harper and I walk along the creek behind town, following the path that winds through cottonwoods. It's cooler here, the water providing relief from the July heat. The path is familiar now—we've walked it a dozen times, and I know exactly where the roots cross the trail, where the best sitting rocks are, which bend gives the best view of the mountains.

I'm starting to know Silver Ridge the way someone who stays would know it. The realization is both comforting and terrifying.

"You're quiet today," Harper observes, stepping over a fallen branch.

"Frank talked to me. Your father came by the job site."

Harper stops walking so abruptly I almost run into her. "What did he say?"

"Asked Frank when I'm leaving. Frank says the whole town's noticed us spending time together. That people are talking."

"Of course they're talking. This is Silver Ridge. They talked when Carol Ann started dating Danny, and they'd known each other their whole lives." She crosses her arms, defensive. "What people say doesn't matter."

"It matters when it's about you. Your reputation—"

"My reputation is my concern." There's steel in her voice I don't hear often. "I'm not some delicate thing that needs protecting from gossip, Jesse. I'm seventeen years old and I can make my own choices."

"But your father—"

"My father worries because he loves me. That doesn't mean he gets to decide who I spend time with." She softens slightly, seeing my expression. "Did Frank say anything else?"

"That I can't have it both ways. Either I'm leaving and need to pull back, or I'm staying and need to make that clear." I run a hand through my hair, frustrated. "He says everyone can see there's something between us. That I need to decide what I'm doing about it."

"Is that what you want? To pull back?"

"No." The answer comes immediately, honest. "But I don't want to hurt you either. And everyone's right—in six weeks I'm supposed to leave. We're letting this go somewhere when there's an expiration date on it."

Harper walks to a large boulder by the creek and sits. I join her, both of us staring at the water rushing past. It's cold and clear from mountain snowmelt, so clear you can see every stone on the bottom. Nothing hidden, everything visible.

Like this conversation.

"Here's what I think," Harper says finally. "People are going to talk no matter what we do. They'll talk if we stop spending time together—they'll say you broke my heart. They'll talk if we keep spending time together—they'll say I'm foolish for falling for someone who's leaving. They'll talk either way, so we might as well do what makes us happy."

"What about your father?"

"I'll talk to my father. He doesn't have to approve, but he'll understand if I explain." She turns to look at me. "Unless you don't want to keep doing this. If you want to pull back, if it's too much pressure, I understand."

"I don't want to pull back."

"Then don't. Let them talk. Let my father worry. Let Frank give warnings." She takes my hand. "We said we'd see what happens these last eight weeks. So let's see. Everything else is noise."

Her certainty is attractive—this girl who's spent seventeen years being good, following rules, meeting expectations, suddenly willing to ignore gossip for something that matters to her.

"Six weeks," I say. "That's all we've got left."

"Then let's make them count."

We sit by the creek until the mosquitoes drive us away, hands linked, listening to water and evening birds. When I walk her home, she kisses my cheek before going inside—quick and sweet and unexpected.

"Goodnight, Jesse."

"Goodnight."

I drive back to Frank's house touching the spot where her lips brushed my cheek, feeling like I'm standing at a crossroads and every direction is terrifying.

That night at dinner, Frank mentions casually that construction permits came through for a fall project—expanding the elementary school. Says it'll run through December, maybe into January.

"Could use reliable help if you're interested," he says, not looking at me. Just cutting his meatloaf, matter-of-fact.

"I don't know if I'll be here."

"Door's open if you are." That's all he says, but the offer hangs there. Permanent work through winter. A reason to stay beyond summer. Money, purpose, a place in the community.

All the things I've been avoiding for two years.

Frank doesn't push, just finishes his dinner and washes his plate. But I know what he's offering—not just a job, but a life. The chance to be someone who builds instead of someone who leaves.

Later, lying in the spare room with the window wide open trying to catch any breeze, I think about Frank's offer and Harper's kiss and the town's gossip. About having six weeks to decide if I'm brave enough to try staying, or coward enough to keep running.

About the fact that I'm in love with Harper Wells and love should make the decision easier but somehow makes it more complicated.

Because loving her means wanting what's best for her. And I'm not sure I'm what's best. She deserves someone stable, someone who knows how to stay, someone the town approves of and her father trusts.

Not a drifter with a truck full of his life and a history of leaving.

But Harper's kiss on my cheek suggests she disagrees about what she deserves. Her certainty earlier—let them talk, let my father worry, let Frank give warnings—suggests she knows her own mind better than I'm giving her credit for.

Maybe I need to stop deciding what's best for Harper and let her decide for herself.

Maybe I need to trust that if she says she wants this—wants us—I should believe her instead of second-guessing her judgment.

The thought is both liberating and terrifying. Liberating because it means I don't have to protect her from me. Terrifying because it means I have to trust her, trust myself, trust that trying might actually work.

The transistor radio on the dresser plays low—Patsy Cline singing about falling to pieces. The irony isn't lost on me. I feel like I'm falling to pieces too, all my carefully constructed walls and defenses crumbling in the face of Harper's honesty and Frank's patient offers and the simple fact that I don't want to leave.

I close my eyes and try to picture September. Try to imagine packing my truck, pointing it south or west, leaving Silver Ridge in the rearview mirror like I've left everywhere else.

The image won't come.

Instead I picture staying. Picture working Frank's fall project, finding a room to rent, settling in for winter. Picture spending more than six weeks with Harper, seeing where this thing between us goes when we're not counting down to goodbye.

The picture is vivid and terrifying and compelling.

And for the first time in two years, it's the picture I actually want.

The thought keeps me awake long into the night, July heat making the spare room feel like an oven, my mind turning over possibilities that terrify and tempt me in equal measure.

Six weeks to figure out if I'm someone who stays or someone who leaves.

Six weeks to decide if love is enough reason to try.

Six weeks to find out if I'm brave enough to believe I might actually be worth keeping around.
