# Chapter 6: Her Questions

Friday afternoon the community center empties early. Some town event, parents picking kids up by four-thirty. Harper and I are alone, cleaning up.

"Thanks for staying to help," she says, stacking chairs. "You didn't have to."

"Nothing else to do."

We work in silence for a few minutes, familiar rhythm now after a couple weeks. I wipe tables while Harper sweeps.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"You've been all over, right? What's that been like?"

It's not the question I expected. Most people ask why I travel or when I'm settling down. Harper's asking about the experience.

"Different. Every place has its own feel."

"Like how?"

I consider while drying my hands. "Desert towns in Arizona are quiet, spread out. Everything's tan and white, lots of sky. Coastal towns in Oregon are damp and green, smell like salt and fish. Montana ranch country is wide open, makes you feel small."

Harper's eyes light up with interest. "You make it sound like they're different countries, not just different states."

"They kind of are. Different landscapes, different people, different problems." I lean against the counter. "Small farming town in California is nothing like a mill town in Oregon, even though they're both small towns."

"What kinds of jobs did you do?"

"Construction mostly, like I'm doing now. Worked a ranch in Montana for a couple months. Helped with harvest in California. Roofing, framing, general labor. Whatever was available."

"That sounds incredible."

"It's interesting," I admit.

"Did you have a favorite place?"

Nobody's ever asked which place I liked best.

"The coast. Northern California, where the redwoods come down to the beach. You could hear the ocean from everywhere, and the trees made you feel like you were in a cathedral."

Harper sits on one of the tables. "What did you do there?"

"Walked on the beach after work. There was a diner, a bar. It was quiet. Peaceful."

"How long did you stay?"

"Three months. Same as here."

"Why did you leave?"

I could deflect. But Harper's listening in a way that makes deflection feel dishonest.

"Because I had this feeling that if I stayed longer I might not leave at all. That scared me."

"So you left before you got too attached."

"Before I got comfortable, yeah."

"Is that why you always move? To avoid getting comfortable?"

Nobody's put it that plainly before.

"Maybe. Or maybe I just like seeing new places."

"Jesse. Those aren't the same thing."

I almost smile. "You don't let me get away with easy answers."

"Should I?"

"Most people do."

"I'm not most people."

She's quoting my own words back, something playful in her expression. We look at each other, and I realize this is dangerous territory.

"What about you?" I ask, deflecting by turning the question around. "You've lived here your whole life?"

"Born and raised in Silver Ridge. Left the state exactly twice—once for a school trip to Kansas City, once to visit my aunt in Denver. That's it." She swings her legs slightly, heels tapping against the table. "Seventeen years in the same town, seeing the same faces, walking the same streets."

"You don't sound happy about that."

"I'm not unhappy. But sometimes I wonder what else is out there. What the ocean looks like in person. What it feels like to be somewhere nobody knows me."

The longing in her voice is familiar.

"Your parents wouldn't let you travel?"

"They expect me to go to college nearby. Come home on weekends. Then come back, marry local, settle down."

"What do you want?"

She's quiet, staring out the window. "I want to see the ocean. Walk through a city where nobody knows me. Figure out who I am when I'm not the minister's daughter." She looks back. "Does that sound selfish?"

"Sounds human."

"My mother says I should be grateful instead of always wanting more."

"You can be grateful and still want to experience new things."

Harper smiles, soft and sad. "Different version of the same thing, maybe. Your family wants you to stay, mine didn't want me around. But either way it's what other people expect versus what you want."

"And you chose what you wanted."

"I chose to leave. Not sure that's the same as choosing what I wanted."

"What do you mean?"

"Leaving was not staying where I wasn't wanted. But I'm not sure I've figured out what I'm moving toward. Just what I'm moving away from."

Harper nods. "That's what scares me about staying. That I'll wake up at forty and realize I never moved toward anything, just stayed because it was easier."

The vulnerability in her voice makes me want to promise her something. But I'm leaving in September. Offering anything would be cruel.

"You're seventeen. You've got time. You don't have to decide everything now."

"You left at sixteen."

"And I've been drifting since. Not exactly a recommendation."

We fall into silence. Outside, the late afternoon sun slants through the windows, painting everything gold. I should probably go, let her finish up and get home for dinner with her family. But I don't want to leave yet, and Harper doesn't seem in a hurry to kick me out.

"Tell me about somewhere else you've been. Somewhere different."

I think for a minute. "There's this town in Arizona, edge of the desert. I worked there last summer."

"What was it like?"

"Hot. Dusty. Everything faded by the sun." I remember the light there. "But at sunset the sky would turn these colors—orange and pink and purple. And at night you could see more stars than I knew existed."

Harper's listening intently. "Did you like it?"

"Parts of it. The sunsets. The quiet." I pause. "But it was also lonely. Just me and my truck and that big empty sky."

"Would you go back?"

"Probably not. I don't usually go back to places. Once you leave, you leave."

"That's sad."

"It's just how I do things."

"Still sad." She hops down from the table. "All those places you've seen, and you never go back. Like they were only meant to be temporary."

"They were only temporary."

"But what if something mattered? What if there was a place you actually wanted to see again?"

The question feels pointed. Harper's looking at me and I find myself answering honestly.

"Then I'd have to decide if going back was worth the risk."

"What risk?"

"That it wouldn't be the same. Or that it would be the same and leaving again would be harder." I meet her eyes. "Sometimes it's easier to keep moving forward."

She starts gathering her things—a cardigan draped over a chair, her car keys, a notebook where she plans activities. I should leave, head back to Frank's house, put some distance between me and this girl who asks questions I don't know how to answer.

But instead I hear myself say, "You should see the ocean. Before college, after college, whenever. But you should go."

"Maybe I will."

"Don't maybe. Actually do it. Take a weekend, drive to California, walk on a beach." The words come out more intense than I intended. "Don't wake up at forty wishing you had."

She looks at me for a long moment, something shifting in her expression. "Will you be sorry you came to Silver Ridge?"

The question catches me completely off guard. "What?"

"When you leave in September. Will you be sorry you spent the summer here, or will it be another place you don't go back to?"

I should say it'll be like everywhere else—just another stop, barely memorable by next year. That's the safe answer, the one that doesn't create expectations or make leaving complicated.

But Harper's still looking at me with that directness that makes deflection feel impossible, and I realize I don't want to lie to her.

"I don't think I'll be sorry I came here," I say quietly. "But I might be sorry I have to leave."

The air between us feels heavy suddenly, charged with something I don't know how to name. Harper's lips part slightly, like she's about to say something important.

Then the community center door bangs open and Reverend Wells walks in.

"Harper, honey, I saw your car still here and thought I'd check— Oh. Jesse. Hello."

I straighten up from the counter, suddenly very aware that I'm alone with his daughter in an empty building late in the afternoon.

"Dad." Harper's voice is normal, maybe a little too bright. "Jesse was helping me clean up. We just finished."

"That's kind of you, Jesse." Reverend Wells' tone is pleasant but his eyes are assessing. "Your uncle Frank mentioned you've been very helpful with the youth programs."

"Just doing what I'm here for, sir."

"Well, we appreciate it." He glances between Harper and me, and I wonder what he sees. "Harper, your mother's holding dinner."

"Right. Sorry." Harper grabs her things quickly. "I'll see you Monday, Jesse?"

"Yeah. Monday."

She follows her father out, glancing back once. I can't read her expression—regret, maybe, or frustration at the interruption, or relief. Maybe all three.

I stand in the empty community center for a minute after they leave, replaying the conversation. Harper asking about places I've been, telling me about wanting to see the world, the moment when I admitted I might be sorry to leave Silver Ridge.

The moment before her father interrupted.

I lock up the building and walk to my truck. The whole drive back to Frank's house, I think about Harper's questions and my answers. How talking to her feels different than talking to anyone else. How she asks about whether I like things, not just what I've done. How she listens like my answers actually matter.

And I think about the way she looked at me when I told her to see the ocean, to not wake up at forty with regrets. Like I'd said something that mattered to her.

Like maybe I matter to her.

That thought should terrify me.

Instead, it makes me want to go back to the community center Monday just to see her again.
