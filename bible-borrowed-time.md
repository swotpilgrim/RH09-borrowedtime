# BIBLE: Borrowed Time

## Story Premise

Jesse Carter is eighteen and has spent two years drifting across the West, never staying anywhere long enough to put down roots. When he arrives in Silver Ridge, Colorado, to work construction for his uncle over the summer of 1957, he's already planning his September departure. Then he meets Harper Wells, the warmhearted good girl who runs youth programs at the community center, and for the first time since leaving home, Jesse wants to stop running. But wanting to stay and knowing how to stay are two different things, and Jesse must choose between the safety of the open road and the terrifying possibility of building a real life with the girl who makes him believe he's worth loving.

## Protagonist: Jesse Carter

**Age:** 18

**Background:** Jesse left home at sixteen after his mother remarried and his stepfather made it clear Jesse was no longer welcome. For two years, he's been a drifter, working odd jobs across western states, sleeping in his truck or cheap motels, never staying longer than a few months. He's learned to travel light, save money, and keep emotional distance. Silver Ridge is just another temporary stop where his uncle offered construction work for the summer.

**Personality:** Jesse's exterior is guarded and self-contained, the protective shell of someone who's learned not to need anyone. He's quietly competent, hardworking, and observant. Beneath the walls, he's thoughtful, lonely, and hungry for connection he won't admit to wanting. He notices details, remembers stories, and has a dry sense of humor that emerges when he feels safe. His greatest fear is being unwanted again, so he leaves before anyone can send him away.

**Goal:** Make it through the summer, earn money, fix his truck, and move on before anyone expects him to stay or realizes he's not worth keeping around.

**Fear/Obstacle:** Jesse's terrified of permanence because he doesn't know how to maintain it. He believes he's fundamentally someone who leaves, and even if he tries to stay for Harper, he'll eventually revert to type and hurt her worse than if he'd never let her in.

**Arc:** Jesse begins the summer convinced he's just passing through and relationships are temporary by design. Through falling in love with Harper, he learns that running isn't protecting him—it's isolating him. By choosing to stay despite his fear, Jesse discovers that borrowed time becomes real when you stop running from connection and start building toward it. He transforms from a boy who leaves to protect himself into a young man willing to risk his heart for something real.

## Love Interest: Harper Wells

**Age:** 17

**Background:** Harper grew up in Silver Ridge, daughter of the local doctor and a schoolteacher. She's lived her whole life in this small mountain town, surrounded by the same faces and the same mountains. Her family is respected, and she's known as the responsible, kindhearted girl who volunteers everywhere. She runs summer programs at the community center and helps with Sunday school. Everyone expects her to marry locally and settle down.

**Personality:** Harper has genuine warmth and treats everyone with kindness, including outsiders like Jesse. She's curious about the world beyond Silver Ridge, reads voraciously, and dreams of travel she's never experienced. She's optimistic but not naive—she knows Jesse's a drifter and tries to guard her heart. She's brave enough to engage with him anyway, drawn to his stories and the life he's lived outside her small town. She values honesty over pretty promises.

**Initial Barrier:** Jesse's a temporary fixture with a departure date already marked on the calendar. Harper knows getting involved with a boy who's leaving is asking for heartbreak, and her parents would disapprove of her spending time with the drifter nephew no one knows.

**Hidden Depth:** Harper's not just the good girl everyone sees. She's restless in Silver Ridge, hungry for experiences beyond the mountains, and lonely in her own way. She sees Jesse's rootlessness not as a flaw but as freedom she craves. She understands running better than Jesse expects.

**Arc:** Harper begins trying to maintain emotional distance from Jesse, knowing he's leaving. As she falls for him, she must decide if loving someone temporary is still worth it, even if it ends in goodbye. By story's end, she learns that asking someone to stay isn't trapping them—it's offering them a reason to choose roots over running.

## Supporting Cast

### Frank Carter - Uncle and Employer
Frank is Jesse's father's older brother, a construction foreman in his late forties who never married. He's gruff but fair, a man of few words who believes in hard work and second chances. Frank offered Jesse the summer job partly out of family obligation, partly because he sees potential in his nephew. He doesn't push Jesse to talk about why he left home, but he models stability and commitment through his actions. Frank attends church regularly and expects Jesse to volunteer at the community center as part of living under his roof. He becomes a quiet father figure who shows Jesse what staying looks like.

### Reverend Thomas Wells - Harper's Father
Harper's father is the town minister, a respected figure who runs the community center programs. He's protective of his daughter and initially wary of Jesse, the drifter with no roots and no future plans. Reverend Wells is kind but firm, and he sees Jesse as a risk to Harper's reputation and heart. As summer progresses and he observes Jesse's work ethic and character, his opposition softens. He represents the authority figure obstacle who must be won over through consistent action, not words.

### Mrs. Eleanor Wells - Harper's Mother
A schoolteacher and pillar of the community, Eleanor is gracious but watchful. She loves her daughter and wants her to be happy, but she also wants Harper to be safe. She's the one who gently reminds Harper that Jesse's leaving, that getting too attached is unwise. Eleanor represents practical wisdom and maternal concern. She's not unkind to Jesse, but she doesn't encourage Harper's growing feelings for him either.

### Danny Pritchard - Best Friend
Danny is Jesse's age, works construction with Frank's crew, and becomes Jesse's only real friend in Silver Ridge. He's local, grew up in town, and plans to take over his father's hardware store someday. Danny is easygoing, loyal, and sees through Jesse's guarded exterior. He's the one who tells Jesse he's an idiot if he leaves Harper behind, the voice of reason who points out that Jesse's fear of staying is just fear, not destiny. Danny represents rootedness and shows Jesse that staying isn't a trap—it's a choice.

### Carol Ann Mitchell - Harper's Best Friend
Carol Ann has known Harper since childhood and is her closest confidante. She's practical, protective, and skeptical of Jesse at first. She warns Harper about getting hurt, reminds her that Jesse's leaving, and serves as the voice of caution. As she watches Jesse with Harper, Carol Ann's opinion shifts. She becomes the friend who tells Harper that sometimes love worth having is worth the risk, even if it's scary. She bridges Harper's world and Jesse's, helping Harper see that letting Jesse in isn't foolish—it's brave.

### Ray Collins - Local Antagonist
Ray is a year older than Jesse, grew up in Silver Ridge, and has always had a thing for Harper. He's not a bad guy, but he's territorial and resentful of the outsider who's caught Harper's attention. Ray makes comments about Jesse being a drifter with no future, questions why Harper wastes time on someone who's leaving, and generally serves as the voice of doubt. He's the external pressure that reinforces Jesse's internal fear that he doesn't belong in Harper's world. Ray represents the town's judgment and Jesse's imposter syndrome made external.

## Setting: Silver Ridge, Colorado

**Time:** Summer 1957 (June through late August)

**Key Locations:**
- **Frank's House:** Small, neat craftsman on the working-class side of town where Jesse stays in the spare room, his temporary home base.
- **Community Center:** Converted old schoolhouse where Harper runs youth programs; the place Jesse volunteers and where he and Harper spend most of their time together.
- **Mountain Trails:** Hiking paths above town where Jesse and Harper escape for honest conversations under open sky, away from watchful eyes.
- **Silver Ridge Diner:** Main Street gathering spot where town gossip flows and where Jesse and Harper's relationship becomes visible to the community.
- **The Overlook:** Scenic viewpoint above town where you can see for miles; represents both Harper's desire to see beyond the mountains and Jesse's comfort with wide-open spaces.
- **Frank's Construction Sites:** Various locations around town where Jesse works, showing his competence and work ethic, earning grudging respect from locals.

**Period Details:** 1957 Colorado mountain town means pickup trucks, work boots, and practical clothing. Jesse's beat-up Chevy truck is both his home and his escape route. Music comes from AM radio—Elvis, Buddy Holly, rockabilly filtering into even isolated towns. The community center has a record player for dances. Church on Sunday isn't optional for respectable families. The end-of-summer festival is the social event of August, with everyone gathering for the season's close.

**Atmosphere:** Silver Ridge is beautiful and isolated, surrounded by mountains that feel both protective and confining. It's a place where everyone knows everyone, where reputation matters, and where outsiders are noticed. The summer setting is warm days and cool mountain nights, perfect for outdoor work and evening conversations under stars. There's a pace and permanence to life here that Jesse both craves and fears—this is a place where people stay, build, and belong.

## Tone & Voice

First-person narration from Jesse's perspective, intimate and introspective. His voice is spare and observant, the internal monologue of someone who's learned to watch more than engage. There's a quiet loneliness beneath his self-sufficiency, moments where his longing for connection breaks through the guardedness. His narration notices details about Harper—the way she laughs, how she makes everyone feel seen, the hurt in her eyes when he talks about leaving. The tone is wistful and searching, capturing the ache of wanting something you're terrified to reach for. Period voice comes through in setting and situation rather than forced slang, keeping it accessible while authentic to 1957. The emotional honesty is contemporary; the world around him is firmly 1950s.

## Theme

The central theme is choosing courage over safety, connection over protection. Jesse's journey is about learning that running from pain doesn't prevent it—it just guarantees loneliness. Borrowed time—the temporary nature he's built his life around—becomes real time when he's willing to risk staying, to believe he's worth keeping, and to trust that love isn't something he'll inevitably lose. It's about the transformation from transience as safety to permanence as possibility, and discovering that home isn't about where you've been, but where you choose to build.

## Romance Trope(s)

The Drifter archetype: boy who's always leaving meets girl who makes him want to stay. Combines "right person, wrong timing" tension with "fear of commitment from trauma" internal conflict. He falls first and harder, recognizing immediately that Harper is different but fighting it because he's convinced he'll hurt her. She tries to protect her heart knowing he's temporary, but falls anyway. The romance builds through everyday moments—working together, hiking, talking under stars—rather than grand gestures. Resolution comes when he chooses her over his fear, proving love through the act of staying rather than the promise of forever.
