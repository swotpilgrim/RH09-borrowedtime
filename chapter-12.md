# Chapter 12: What He Wants vs. What He Knows

Night, mid-July. I lie awake in Frank's spare room analyzing the same questions I've been avoiding for weeks.

What would staying actually require?

First: permanent work. Frank's offered the fall school project, says it runs through December maybe into January. After that there'd be other jobs—there's always construction in a growing town. Or I could find work elsewhere—the hardware store, one of the ranches outside town, something. Silver Ridge is small but there's work for someone willing to do it.

Second: a place to live. Can't stay in Frank's spare room forever. I'd need to find housing—rent a room somewhere, maybe eventually get my own place. That means stability, routine, a permanent address for the first time in two years.

Third: commitment to a town where I'm still the outsider. Frank and Danny accept me, Harper more than accepts me, but to the rest of Silver Ridge I'm Frank Carter's nephew who showed up in June. Would they ever see me as someone who belongs? Or would I always be the drifter who stayed?

Fourth, most terrifying: I'd need to trust myself not to eventually revert to drifting. What if I stay six months, a year, and then wake up one morning needing the road? What if I hurt Harper infinitely worse than leaving now would hurt her?

That's the calculation that keeps me awake.

I want to stay. I want Harper. I want this glimpse of stable life I've had with her—the routine of work and community center and evening walks, the feeling of being known and wanted. I want to see where this thing between us could go if we had more than six weeks.

But wanting and knowing how are different things.

I've spent two years proving I'm someone who leaves. Working temporary jobs, living in temporary rooms, forming temporary connections. I've perfected the art of moving on before anyone expects me to stay.

Silver Ridge would require unlearning all of that. Would require believing I'm capable of staying even when it gets hard. Would require trusting that people wanting me around isn't temporary.

And I don't know if I can do that.

The evidence suggests I can't. My whole life has been people not wanting me around—my stepfather making it clear I was in the way, my mother choosing her new husband over me, every temporary job and temporary room confirming that nothing lasts.

How do I trust that Silver Ridge would be different? That Harper's feelings won't change? That the town won't eventually decide I don't belong?

I turn over, staring at the water stain on the ceiling that looks like a bird in flight. Or a cloud. Depends on how you look at it.

Maybe that's the problem—I'm looking at this all wrong.

I've been asking: can I stay? Can I be someone who stays instead of someone who leaves?

But maybe the question is: do I want to try?

Because Harper's right—I've never actually tried staying anywhere. I've left before I could find out if I'm capable of it. I've been so afraid of failing that I've guaranteed failure by never attempting success.

What if I stayed in Silver Ridge and it worked? What if I'm actually good at staying and I've just never given myself the chance to find out?

That possibility terrifies me more than the possibility of failure.

Because if I stay and succeed, it means everything I've believed about myself for two years is wrong. It means my stepfather was wrong—that I am someone worth keeping around. It means all the leaving I've done was unnecessary, that I could have built something somewhere but was too afraid to try.

It means I've wasted two years running from something that was never chasing me.

The thought makes my chest tight, makes it hard to breathe in the stuffy spare room.

I've constructed this whole identity around being a drifter, someone who doesn't stay, someone who's comfortable with temporary. I've told myself it's freedom, independence, seeing the world. But what if it's just fear wearing a more acceptable face?

What if I'm not a free spirit who chooses to wander, but a scared kid who never learned that home doesn't have to be something that pushes you away?

The realization feels like standing on the edge of something vast and unknowable. Like I could step forward into it or step back to safety, but staying on the edge isn't sustainable.

I have to choose.

I get up, move to the window. Outside, Silver Ridge sleeps—houses dark except for a few lit windows, streetlights casting pools of yellow on empty sidewalks. Quiet and peaceful and permanent. The kind of town people build lives in, raise families in, grow old in.

The kind of town I could maybe build a life in, if I was brave enough.

Through the window I can see the mountains, dark shapes against the starlit sky. Mountains that have been here longer than Silver Ridge, longer than anyone alive, solid and unchanging. They don't run. They don't leave. They just are.

What if I could be like that? What if I could just be instead of constantly running toward the next thing?

The spare room suddenly feels too small, the walls too close. I need to think, need to move, need to do something besides lie here spiraling through the same questions.

I grab my keys, slip out quietly so I don't wake Frank, and drive.

I don't plan where I'm going, just drive through sleeping Silver Ridge and up the mountain road to the overlook. The place Harper showed me, where you can see the whole valley spread below and everything feels both smaller and more significant.

I park and get out, leaning against the truck bed where Harper and I sat that first time she brought me here. The view is different at night—no details visible, just darkness and distant lights. But the mountains are visible as darker shapes against the sky, solid and enduring.

"What am I supposed to do?" I ask the darkness.

The darkness doesn't answer. The mountains don't offer advice. But standing here alone in the middle of the night, I realize something.

I've been asking the wrong person.

I've been trying to logic my way through this—analyzing what staying requires, cataloguing my fears, weighing evidence for and against my ability to commit. Treating it like a problem to solve rather than a choice to make.

But this isn't about logic. It's about what I want.

And I want to stay.

I want to see where things go with Harper. Want to keep working with Frank. Want to make Danny and Carol Ann and the other people I've met into real friends instead of temporary connections. Want to learn Silver Ridge the way Harper knows it—every trail, every story, every corner full of meaning.

I want to stop running.

That's what it comes down to. Not can I stay, but do I want to. And I do.

The fear is still there—fear of failing, fear of being unwanted again, fear of proving my stepfather right. But underneath the fear is something stronger: the desire to try.

Maybe I'll fail. Maybe I'll stay six months and need to leave. Maybe Harper will realize I'm not what she wants. Maybe the town will never fully accept me.

But maybe none of that will happen.

Maybe I'll stay and succeed. Maybe Harper and I will build something real. Maybe I'll prove I'm someone worth keeping around.

I won't know unless I try.

The realization feels both heavy and liberating. Heavy because it means taking a risk I've avoided for two years. Liberating because it means I'm choosing instead of letting fear choose for me.

I stand there on the overlook until the sky starts to lighten—just a gray hint of dawn touching the eastern mountains. Then I drive back down to Silver Ridge, to Frank's house, to the spare room that's been temporary for two months.

And I know—really know—what I'm going to do.

I'm going to try staying.

I'm going to tell Frank I'll take the fall job. Going to find permanent housing. Going to tell Harper I want to see what happens between us beyond six weeks.

I'm going to risk everything I've been protecting myself from for two years.

And I'm terrified.

But I'm also, for the first time in a long time, hopeful.

Because wanting to stay and trying to stay are two different things. And trying, even if I fail, is braver than running.

Harper said I could learn to stay. That people learn new things all the time.

So I'm going to learn.

And if I fail—if I try and it doesn't work—at least I'll know I tried. At least I'll know I was brave enough to risk it.

That has to be enough.

That has to be better than spending the rest of my life wondering what would have happened if I'd stayed.
