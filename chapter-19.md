# Chapter 19: Her Father's Conversation

"Jesse, could you stay a moment?"

Reverend Wells' voice was calm, but it stopped me in my tracks as I headed toward the community center exit. The afternoon session had just ended, families collecting their kids, Harper organizing supplies on the far side of the room.

"Yes, sir."

"My office, if you don't mind."

It wasn't really a question. I followed the Reverend to his small office at the back of the building. He gestured to the chair across from his desk and closed the door with a quiet click that felt final.

The office was simple—wooden desk, two chairs, bookshelves lined with religious texts. Late afternoon light slanted through the window.

Reverend Wells settled into his chair and regarded me. He wasn't a big man, but he had presence—the kind that came from genuine conviction. Kind but not soft, compassionate but not naive.

"I imagine you know why I wanted to talk," he said.

"I can guess, sir."

"I've been watching you with my daughter all summer."

Heat crept up my neck. "Sir, I never—we haven't—"

He held up a hand. "I'm not accusing you of impropriety, Jesse. You've been respectful. Harper's mother and I appreciate that." He leaned back in his chair. "But respect and intentions are two different things. I need to know what your intentions are toward Harper."

The question hung in the air between us. Straightforward. Fair. Impossible to answer.

"I care about her," I said finally.

"That much is obvious. The question is what you plan to do about it."

"I don't know."

"You don't know if you care, or you don't know what you plan to do?"

"I know I care." I dragged a hand through my hair. "I just don't know what I'm capable of giving her."

"Explain that."

I met his eyes, trying to find words for the truth I barely understood myself. "Harper deserves someone who can promise her a future. Someone who knows how to stay in one place, build a life, be part of a community. I'm not that person."

"You've been part of this community all summer."

"As a temporary worker. A visitor. That's different from actually belonging."

"Is it?" Reverend Wells tilted his head slightly. "You've worked hard for your uncle. Volunteered here regularly. Made friends. Helped our children. That seems like belonging to me."

"For a summer. I can do anything for a summer." The admission came out rougher than I intended. "But permanent? I've been on the road for two years. Every place is temporary. Every job, every person. That's what I do—I move on."

"That's what you've *done*," the Reverend corrected, echoing Carol Ann's words from weeks ago. "Past tense."

"But that's who I am." I heard the desperation in my voice. "My track record proves it. I left home at sixteen and I haven't stopped moving since. What if that's just my nature? What if I can't change it?"

The Reverend was quiet for a long moment.

"Can I tell you what I see, Jesse?"

I nodded, throat tight.

"I see a young man who's been hurt." His voice was gentle now. "I see someone who left home not because he wanted to wander, but because he was made to feel unwanted. I see someone who learned to leave before being left, who built a life around moving on because moving on felt safer than risking rejection again."

The words hit like a punch to the chest. How did he see so clearly what I'd been hiding even from myself?

"I also see," the Reverend continued, "a young man who's been happy here. Who's found something worth staying for, and that terrifies him. Because if he admits he wants to stay, and then something goes wrong, it'll hurt worse than just keeping moving."

I couldn't speak. Couldn't confirm or deny. Could only sit there while this minister I'd known for three months laid bare every fear I'd been carrying.

"Here's the thing about patterns, Jesse." Reverend Wells leaned forward, elbows on his desk. "They're just patterns. They're not destiny. They're not who you *are*—they're what you've *done*. And what you've done can change any time you decide to do something different."

"But what if I decide to change and can't? What if I try to stay and fail at it?"

"That's a risk," he acknowledged. "But it's also a risk to run from something good because you're afraid of failing. The question is which risk you'd rather take—the risk of trying and possibly failing, or the risk of walking away and definitely losing."

I thought about Harper's face when Megan asked if I was leaving before the festival. The hurt she tried to hide. The distance she'd built to protect herself after I'd built mine.

"I don't want to hurt her," I said quietly.

"I know. That's why I'm having this conversation instead of telling you to stay away." The Reverend's expression softened. "You're a good young man with a good heart. But you're letting fear drive you, and fear is a terrible navigator."

"How do I stop being afraid?"

"You don't. Fear doesn't disappear. You just choose to act despite it. Bravery isn't the absence of fear—it's doing the right thing even when you're terrified."

"What if I don't know what the right thing is?"

Reverend Wells smiled slightly. "I think you do know. You're just scared to do it."

He wasn't wrong. Deep down, I knew what I wanted. Harper. This town. To stop running and build something real.

I just didn't know if I was brave enough.

"As Harper's father," the Reverend said, bringing us back to the purpose of this conversation, "I need to know what you're planning. Are you staying in Silver Ridge, or are you leaving?"

"I..." The words stuck in my throat. "I don't know."

He nodded slowly, as if he'd expected that answer. "Then let me be clear about something. I won't forbid Harper from seeing you. She's almost eighteen, and she's got a good head on her shoulders. She makes her own choices." He paused, making sure I was listening. "But if you're planning to leave, I ask that you be honest with her about it. Don't let her hope for something you can't give. And if you're even considering staying, really considering it, then consider it seriously. Don't make promises you're not sure you can keep."

"And if I don't know which one I'm going to do?"

"Then you need to figure it out. Soon." His tone was still gentle, but there was steel underneath. "Because my daughter's heart is at stake, and she deserves better than borrowed time and maybe."

The phrase hit hard. *Borrowed time.* That's exactly what this summer had been—borrowed time that I'd always known would end.

Except maybe it didn't have to.

"You asked what I'm running from versus what I'm running toward," I said slowly, working through thoughts as I spoke them. "I've been running from the feeling of being unwanted. From my stepfather making it clear I was a burden. From the idea that I don't fit anywhere, so why try?"

"And what are you running toward?"

I thought about the open road, the truck that had been my home, the freedom of no commitments and no expectations. I thought about new towns and new jobs and the safety of never staying long enough to be told I wasn't wanted.

"Nothing," I admitted. "I'm not running toward anything. I'm just running."

The Reverend let that sit between us for a moment.

"What if you stopped?" he asked quietly.

"I don't know what that looks like."

"It looks like staying. Getting a permanent job. Renting a place. Making commitments. Building a life." He watched me carefully. "It looks like risking your heart on my daughter and trusting that maybe, just maybe, you're worth keeping around."

The vulnerability of that thought made my chest tight. "What if I'm not? Worth keeping around?"

"Jesse." The Reverend's voice was firm now. "You've been here all summer. You've worked hard, helped our community, treated my daughter with respect and kindness. Frank speaks highly of you. Danny considers you a friend. The children here adore you. The only person who doesn't seem to think you're worth keeping around is you."

The observation settled into my bones, heavy and true.

"I'm scared," I admitted, the words barely a whisper.

"I know." Reverend Wells stood, came around the desk, and put a hand on my shoulder. "But being scared doesn't excuse you from choosing. You're going to hurt either way, son. If you leave, you'll hurt from losing her. If you stay and it doesn't work out, you'll hurt from failure. The question is whether you want to hurt from trying or hurt from running."

He moved to the door, opened it, then turned back to me.

"I trust you to do right by Harper, Jesse. Whatever that means for you." His eyes held mine. "I just ask that you make your decision honestly. Don't hide behind fear and call it protection. Be brave enough to want what you want, and then be brave enough to reach for it or walk away cleanly."

"Yes, sir."

He nodded and left the office, leaving me sitting in the chair with late afternoon sun warming my back and the weight of his words pressing on my chest.

*Be brave enough to want what you want.*

I wanted Harper. I wanted to stay. I wanted to believe I could be someone who builds instead of runs, someone who stays instead of leaves.

But wanting it and doing it were two different things.

I stood and walked out of the office. The hallway was empty, the community center quiet except for Harper in the main room, still organizing supplies.

She didn't look up when I passed. Didn't acknowledge my presence. The distance between us felt like miles even though we were separated by a few dozen feet.

I left the building and sat in my truck, hands on the steering wheel, engine off.

The Reverend had given me permission to choose Harper. Had validated that I'd been part of this community, that I belonged here if I wanted to belong. He'd seen through my fear to the hurt underneath, and he'd challenged me to stop letting that hurt dictate my future.

He'd also made clear that Harper deserved honesty. Deserved more than borrowed time and maybe.

She deserved a choice. A real one.

Which meant I had to make mine.

I started the truck and drove back to Frank's house, the Reverend's question echoing in my head: *What if you stopped running?*

I didn't have an answer yet.

But I was starting to think I needed to find one.
