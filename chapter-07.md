# Chapter 7: Her Dreams

End of third week of June. Kids have all gone home and Harper and I are cleaning up. She's organizing art supplies while I stack chairs, familiar routine now.

"What's your favorite place you've ever been?" Harper asks. She's sorting colored pencils, not looking at me.

I pause. "The California coast. Northern California."

"What made it your favorite?"

"The way the Pacific looks at sunset. Endless water meeting the sky so far out you can't tell where one ends and the other begins." I can smell the salt air in memory. "The color changes—blue to gray to almost black. And the sound of the waves never stops. Like the ocean's breathing."

Harper's stopped sorting, watching me now. Longing in her eyes.

"I've never seen the ocean," she says quietly.

"Never?"

"Never. I've seen pictures, photographs. But I've never stood on a beach or heard waves or smelled salt air." She looks down at the pencils. "I try to imagine it, but I don't think I can really picture it. Not the way someone who's been there can."

Her voice aches with longing. I've seen the ocean a dozen times, taken it for granted. But Harper's spent seventeen years in these mountains, dreaming about water she's only seen in pictures.

"You should go," I say. "Just drive west until you hit the coast. It's not that far from Colorado."

"I know it's not far. My dad has maps in his study. I've looked." She sets the pencil box aside and sits on one of the craft tables, feet dangling. "I've planned the trip in my head probably a hundred times. What route I'd take, what beaches I'd visit. There's this place in California—Big Sur—I've read about it in travel magazines. The highway runs right along the cliffs above the ocean."

"Big Sur's incredible. Rocky coastline, dramatic cliffs, the water's this deep blue-green." I remember driving that highway, the vertigo of it. "It's maybe the most beautiful place I've ever seen."

"You've been there?"

"Drove through once. Didn't stop long enough, just passed through on my way to a job further north." I regret that now, the not stopping. "If I went back I'd spend more time there."

"Would you go back?" She tilts her head, curious. "You said you don't usually."

"For Big Sur I might make an exception."

Harper smiles, wistful. "Tell me what else you'd want to see if you went back."

So I do. I describe the way the fog rolls in off the Pacific in the mornings, how it clings to the hillsides like cotton. The sea lions barking on the rocks. The redwood forests just inland where the trees block out the sun and everything's green and quiet and smells like earth.

Harper listens like I'm telling her stories from another world. Which I guess I am, in a way. These places I'm describing might as well be foreign countries to her—far away, only accessible through other people's descriptions, as unreal as photographs.

"What else do you want to see?" I ask. "Besides the ocean."

She doesn't hesitate. "Everything. I want to see New York City. I want to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and see the Statue of Liberty and eat at a real deli. I want to see the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls and the Rocky Mountains in Canada, not just Colorado."  She's gaining momentum now, words spilling out like she's kept them bottled up. "I want to go to New Orleans and hear jazz music in the clubs. I want to see the desert in Arizona—not the ocean but that completely different landscape you described, all that heat and sky and stars."

I'm struck by how specific her dreams are. These aren't vague wishes. She's thought about this, planned it out in detail.

"You've really thought about all this."

"I have books." She says it almost defensively. "Travel guides, National Geographic, library books about different places. I read them and imagine what it would be like to actually go there instead of just seeing pictures."

"Why don't you go? Take a trip, see some of these places."

Harper's expression shifts, the excitement dimming. "My parents wouldn't understand."

"You're seventeen. Almost eighteen. You don't need their permission."

"It's not about permission exactly." She struggles to explain. "It's about expectations. My father's the minister. My mother teaches Sunday school. I'm supposed to be the good daughter who stays close, goes to a respectable college nearby, comes home on weekends." She looks out the window at the mountains. "They love me. They want what's best for me. They just think what's best is staying here."

"What do you think is best?"

She's quiet for a long moment. "I think staying without ever leaving would feel like giving up before I even started. Like deciding my whole life when I'm seventeen and never questioning it."

I understand that completely. Different circumstances—her family wants her to stay, mine pushed me out—but the same underlying question: do you live the life other people plan for you, or do you figure out what you actually want?

"You should see the ocean," I say firmly. "Before you decide anything else. Drive to California, walk on a beach, see Big Sur. Then figure out if you want to come back to Silver Ridge."

Harper looks at me, something vulnerable in her eyes. "What if I go and realize I don't want to come back? What if I see all these places I've been dreaming about and can't stand the thought of coming home to these mountains?"

"Then you'll know. And you can make decisions based on what you actually want instead of what you think you're supposed to want."

"My parents would be heartbroken."

"Maybe. Or maybe they'd understand better than you think."

"You don't know my parents."

"No," I admit. "But I know what it's like to make decisions based on other people's expectations instead of your own wants. It doesn't end well either way."

Harper moves to the window, looking out at Silver Ridge spread below—main street, church steeple, mountains ringing everything like walls. Or protection, depending on how you look at it.

"I love this town," she says quietly. "But sometimes I look at those mountains and they feel less like protection and more like a cage."

I move to stand beside her. "You can love a place and still need to leave it for a while."

"Is that how you feel about California?"

"No. I left because I needed to leave, not because I loved it. But I've been other places I could see myself loving if I stayed." I glance at her. "Silver Ridge, maybe."

She looks up, surprised. "You like it here?"

"It's a good town. Good people."

"But you're still leaving in September."

"Yeah."

"Because you don't know how to stay places," Harper says. "There's a difference."

She turns to face me fully. "What if you did? Know how to stay, I mean. Would you?"

Dangerous question. The kind that implies possibilities I shouldn't be considering. Ten weeks left. Ten weeks until I pack my truck and leave Silver Ridge like every other town.

But standing here with Harper looking at me like my answer matters, I imagine staying. Working Frank's crew year-round. Seeing Harper beyond summer, into autumn and winter and maybe spring.

The image scares me.

"I don't know," I say honestly. "I've never stayed anywhere long enough to find out."

"But if you could. Hypothetically. Would you want to?"

She's really asking would I want to stay here. Near her.

I should deflect. But Harper's looking at me with such directness that deflection feels like cowardice.

"Maybe," I say. "If I had a reason to."

The air between us feels charged suddenly, heavy with things unsaid. Harper's still looking at me, and I'm very aware of how close we're standing, how the late afternoon light through the window catches in her dark hair, how her eyes are more gold than brown in this light.

I should step back. Put distance between us. Remember that she's the minister's daughter and I'm the drifter who'll be gone in ten weeks and getting attached would be a mistake for both of us.

But I don't step back.

Neither does she.

"I should go," Harper says finally, but she doesn't move. "My mother's expecting me for dinner."

"Yeah. You should go."

Still neither of us moves.

"Jesse?" Her voice is quiet.

"Yeah?"

"When you leave in September..." She trails off, like she's not sure how to finish the question.

"What?"

"Nothing. Never mind." She grabs her cardigan from the chair, her car keys. "I'll see you Monday."

"Harper, what were you going to ask?"

She pauses at the door, looking back. "I was going to ask if you'd miss this place. But I realized I don't want to know the answer."

Before I can respond, she's gone. The door closes behind her and I'm left standing alone in the empty community center, the late afternoon sun slanting through windows, her question hanging in the air.

Would I miss this place?

Would I miss Silver Ridge with its mountains and small-town familiarity, Frank's quiet presence and Danny's easy friendship?

Or is the real question would I miss her?

I already know that answer. I'm going to miss Harper Wells more than I've missed anyone or anywhere in two years of leaving places behind.

And I've got ten weeks to figure out what to do about that.

Or ten weeks to make sure I don't get any more attached than I already am.

I lock up the community center and walk to my truck, Harper's words echoing in my head. I don't want to know the answer. Because the answer scares her, maybe. Or because she thinks she already knows what it is.

I drive back to Frank's house through a town that's starting to feel less temporary and more like somewhere I could imagine staying. The mountains don't look like walls tonight. They look like protection, like arms holding the town safe.

And that's the most dangerous thought of all.

Because I don't do safe. I don't do staying. I don't do any of the things that Harper Wells represents—roots and community and belonging somewhere instead of just passing through.

But God help me, I'm starting to want to.
