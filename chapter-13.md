# Chapter 13: Harper's Awareness

Harper's not blind to my internal struggle. She sees me pull back when conversations turn to fall plans, notices how I change subject when September gets mentioned. After a community center session in the third week of July, she asks if we can talk privately.

We sit on the steps outside, late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the lawn.

"You've been different lately," Harper says. "More distant. Like you're already leaving even though you're still here."

I don't know how to explain that I've been wrestling with the decision to stay, that my distance has been self-protection while I figured things out.

"I've been thinking a lot."

"About leaving?"

"About staying."

Her head turns sharply. "Staying?"

"Maybe. I don't know." I run a hand through my hair, frustrated with my inability to articulate this. "Frank offered me permanent work. Construction through fall and winter. And I've been trying to figure out if I could actually do it—stay somewhere, commit to something."

"And?"

"And I'm terrified. But I think I want to try."

Harper's quiet for a long moment. When she speaks, her voice is careful. "You think you want to try?"

"I know I want to try," I correct. "I'm just scared I'll fail."

"What does failure look like?"

"Staying for a while and then needing to leave anyway. Hurting you worse than leaving now would hurt you." I meet her eyes. "Proving everyone who's ever thought I wasn't worth keeping around was right."

Harper shifts to face me fully. "Jesse, I need to know something. Are you thinking about staying for you, or are you thinking about staying for me?"

The question catches me off guard. "Does it matter?"

"Yes. Because if you're only staying for me, that's too much pressure. I can't be your only reason. You'll resent me eventually, or you'll leave anyway and blame me for trying to hold you here." She pauses. "But if you want to stay for you—because you want to build something, because you're tired of running—then me being here is a bonus, not the burden."

I've never thought about it that way. I've been so focused on Harper as my reason for considering staying that I haven't examined whether I want to stay independent of her.

"I want to stop running," I say slowly. "I'm tired of temporary everything. Tired of never belonging anywhere. And yeah, you're a big part of why Silver Ridge feels different. But it's not just you." I think about Frank's quiet approval, Danny's easy friendship, even the community center kids who've started expecting me to be there. "It's the whole town. It feels like somewhere I could belong if I let myself."

Harper nods. "That's what I needed to hear. Because I care about you, Jesse. A lot. But I can't be your only anchor. That's not fair to either of us."

"So what do we do?"

"You figure out what you want, independent of me. And I'll figure out what I want, independent of you. Then we see if those things can coexist."

It's more mature than I expected, more complicated than just staying because we have feelings for each other. But Harper's right—she can't be my only reason, and I can't be hers.

"What do you want?" I ask.

Harper looks out at Silver Ridge spread below us—the church steeple, the main street, the mountains ringing everything.

"I want to see the world before I settle anywhere. I want to go to college, maybe somewhere far from here. I want to figure out who I am when I'm not the minister's daughter." She glances at me. "But I also want you. I want to see what we could be if we had more than six weeks."

"Those things might conflict."

"I know. That's what I'm trying to figure out." She takes a breath. "My parents want me to go to Colorado State. It's close enough to come home on weekends. But I've been thinking about schools farther away. California, maybe. Or back east."

"Because of me?"

"Because of me," she corrects. "Because spending time with you has shown me that there's a whole world out there I've only read about. Because you've made me braver about wanting things for myself instead of just accepting what's expected."

The weight of that responsibility settles on me. I've made her want to leave, to take risks, to disappoint people she loves. That wasn't my intention but it's the result.

"Harper, I don't want to be the reason you—"

"You're not the reason. You're the catalyst. There's a difference." She turns to face me fully. "I've wanted to leave for years. I just never had the courage. You've shown me that leaving is possible, that wanting more doesn't make me selfish. You've given me permission to want things for myself."

"Your parents won't see it that way."

"Maybe not at first. But they'll understand eventually." She pauses. "The point is, I can't ask you to stay if I'm planning to leave. That's not fair either."

We're quiet for a while, both of us grappling with the complication we've created. I might stay, she might leave. Or I might leave and she might stay. Or we both might leave in different directions.

"This is messy," I say finally.

"Yeah." Harper almost laughs. "Really messy."

"What if we can't figure it out? What if what we want is too different?"

"Then we'll deal with that when we know for sure. But right now we're both making decisions based on fear and uncertainty. Maybe we should wait until we actually know what we want before we decide it's impossible."

She's right. We're letting hypotheticals paralyze us, worrying about conflicts that might not even exist.

"So what do we do?"

"We keep talking. We're honest about what we're thinking and feeling. And we don't make any decisions based on what we think the other person wants." Harper takes my hand. "Deal?"

"Deal."

We sit there as the sun gets lower, hands linked, the complications still there but somehow more manageable now that they're out in the open.

"I'm glad you're thinking about staying," Harper says quietly.

"Even if you're thinking about leaving?"

"Especially because I'm thinking about leaving. Because it means we're both choosing what we want instead of just accepting what's expected. That's brave."

"I don't feel brave."

"You are though. Even thinking about staying when it terrifies you—that's brave."

Maybe she's right. Maybe bravery isn't the absence of fear but doing the thing anyway.

"Harper?"

"Yeah?"

"Thanks for not making this simpler. For not just saying you'll stay so I'll stay or you'll go so I can leave without guilt. For insisting we both figure out what we actually want."

"You're welcome. But also, you're welcome for making this incredibly complicated." She smiles. "We could have just had a nice uncomplicated summer romance where we said goodbye in September and went our separate ways."

"That would have been easier."

"But not better."

No. Not better at all.

Because this—complicated and messy and uncertain as it is—feels real in a way nothing has felt in two years.

And real is worth the complication.
