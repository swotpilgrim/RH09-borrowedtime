# Chapter 15: The Question She Doesn't Ask

Late July evening, last week of the month. Harper and I drive to the overlook after the community center closes. It's become our place—this spot above town where we can talk honestly without the weight of watching eyes.

We sit on the truck bed watching sunset paint the sky. The air is cooling after another hot day, mountain breeze carrying the scent of pine. Below us, Silver Ridge settles into evening.

"Three weeks," Harper says quietly. "That's what's left of summer."

"I told Frank I'm taking the fall job."

"I know. You told me." She swings her legs, heels tapping against the truck bed. "Have you told your mom? That you're staying somewhere?"

The question catches me off guard. I haven't talked to my mother in two years—not since I left. Haven't sent an address because I never had one worth sending. Haven't called because what would I say?

"No."

"Are you going to?"

"I don't know. Maybe." I pick at the truck bed's paint, flaking under my thumbnail. "What would I even say? 'Hey, I've been drifting for two years but I found a town in Colorado and I think I'm staying'?"

"Something like that. She's probably worried."

"She chose Jim. She made it clear where her priorities were."

"Parents make mistakes. Doesn't mean they stop caring." Harper pauses. "My dad asked about you again. Your plans, your intentions."

"What did you tell him?"

"That you're staying. That we're seeing what happens between us. That he doesn't have to approve but he has to accept it."

"How'd he take that?"

"Better than expected. Worse than I hoped." She smiles slightly. "He's protective. But he also trusts me to make my own choices, even when he disagrees with them."

We're quiet for a moment. Then Harper asks, "What does staying look like? Practically, I mean?"

"Frank's project starts first week of September. I'll need to find permanent housing—can't live in his spare room forever. Probably rent a room somewhere." I've been thinking about this. "Save money, maybe eventually get my own place. Build something stable."

"And us? What do we look like?"

The question I've been avoiding. "What do you want us to look like?"

"I asked first."

Fair enough. "I want to keep doing this. Spending time together, figuring things out, seeing where it goes." I look at her. "But I also know you're thinking about college. About your future."

Harper's quiet for a long moment, staring out at the mountains. "I'll be a senior this fall. Have to start thinking about college applications."

"Your parents want you to stay close, right?"

"Colorado State. Close enough to come home on weekends." She picks at a thread on her jeans. "They've been talking about it since I was fourteen. Like it's already decided."

"But that's not what you want."

"I don't know what I want." She looks at me. "Part of me wants to stay close, make them happy, be the good daughter. But part of me wants to go somewhere far away, somewhere nobody knows me as the minister's daughter. Figure out who I am without all these expectations."

I understand that completely. "You've got time to decide."

"Not much. Applications are due in a few months." She swings her legs, heels tapping against the truck bed. "But that's next year's problem, right? First I have to finish senior year."

We're quiet for a moment, both of us aware of how uncertain the future is. Me trying to stay somewhere for the first time. Her trying to figure out whether to leave.

"Can I ask you something?" Harper's voice changes, becomes more serious.

"Sure."

"Is there any version of September where you stay? Really stay, I mean. Not just take Frank's job and keep one foot out the door, but actually commit to building something here?"

The question hits harder than I expect. That's exactly what I've been avoiding—the difference between physically staying and actually committing to a life here.

"I don't know," I admit. "I want to. I told Frank I'm taking the fall job. But wanting to stay and knowing how to stay are different things."

"What scares you about it?"

"Everything." The honesty comes easier now, with Harper. "What if I try and fail? What if I stay for six months or a year and then wake up needing the road again? What if I hurt you worse than leaving now would hurt you?"

"I understand," she says quietly. "I knew from the start this was temporary. That you were just here for the summer." Her voice is steady but I can hear the hurt underneath. "I tried not to get too attached, but I guess I wasn't very good at that."

"Harper—"

"It's okay." She wipes at her eyes quickly, not letting the tears fall. "You've been honest the whole time. You never promised to stay. I just... I hoped maybe I'd be worth trying for."

The unasked question hangs between us: Am I not worth trying for?

It cuts deeper than any accusation could, because she is worth trying for. She's worth everything. But I'm so terrified of failing her that I can't make myself promise what she deserves.

"You are worth it," I say, my voice rough. "Harper, you're worth everything. It's not about you. It's about me being too afraid to trust myself."

"I know." She looks at me, and there's understanding in her eyes along with the hurt. "But knowing it doesn't make it easier."

The sky's darkening now, stars multiplying overhead. The evening star hangs low over the western mountains. The town lights twinkle below like fallen stars. It's beautiful and peaceful, and I'm ruining it by being a coward.

We sit in silence for a long moment. Then Harper slides off the truck bed.

"We should go. I told my parents I'd be home by nine."

The drive back to town is quiet. Not the comfortable silence we usually share, but something heavier. Harper stares out the window at the passing darkness, and I keep my eyes on the road, my hands tight on the steering wheel.

I want to reach for her hand. Want to promise her I'll stay, that I'll never leave, that she's enough to make me brave. But the words stick in my throat, choked by fear.

At her house, Harper pauses with her hand on the door handle.

"Thank you for being honest with me tonight," she says. "For not making promises you don't think you can keep."

"Harper—"

"I need to think about some things." She looks at me, and there's something in her expression I can't quite read. "About whether I can handle loving someone on borrowed time. Whether that's fair to either of us."

The word "loving" makes my chest ache. She loves me. And I'm hurting her because I'm too scared to love her back the way she deserves.

"I understand."

"Do you?" There's no anger in her voice, just sadness. "I don't think you do, Jesse. I don't think you understand what it's like to watch someone you love choose fear over you. But maybe that's not fair. Maybe fear isn't a choice."

She opens the door and slides out of the truck.

"Night, Jesse."

"Night."

I watch her walk to her door, her shoulders straight, her head up. She doesn't turn and wave like she usually does. Just goes inside and closes the door behind her.

I sit in the truck for a long moment, staring at her house, the light in what I think is her bedroom window.

I'm hurting her. Right now, tonight, I'm breaking her heart because I'm not brave enough to risk staying. I told myself I was protecting her by being honest about my fear, but Harper's right—I'm choosing fear over her.

And she deserves better than that.

The drive back to Frank's house feels longer than it should. Every turn, every street, every familiar landmark reminds me that I'm building something here despite myself. That Silver Ridge has stopped being temporary and started being home.

But I'm still too afraid to admit it.

That night, lying in Frank's spare room, I stare at the water stain on the ceiling and replay the conversation. Harper asking if there's any version where I really stay. Me admitting I don't know how. Her eyes filling with hurt she tried to hide.

The question she didn't quite ask but I heard anyway: Am I not worth trying for?

She is. God, she is.

But I'm so scared of failing her, of proving that I'm exactly what my stepfather thought I was—someone not worth keeping around—that I can't make myself take the risk.

Three weeks until September. Three weeks to figure out if I'm brave enough to choose love over fear.

Three weeks to decide if Harper Wells is worth risking everything I've been protecting myself from for two years.

I already know the answer.

The question is whether I'm brave enough to act on it.
