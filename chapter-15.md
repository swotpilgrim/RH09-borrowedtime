# Chapter 15: The Question She Doesn't Ask

Late July evening, last week of the month. Harper and I drive to the overlook after the community center closes. It's become our place—this spot above town where we can talk honestly without the weight of watching eyes.

We sit on the truck bed watching sunset paint the sky. The air is cooling after another hot day, mountain breeze carrying the scent of pine. Below us, Silver Ridge settles into evening.

"Three weeks," Harper says quietly. "That's what's left of summer."

"I told Frank I'm taking the fall job."

"I know. You told me." She swings her legs, heels tapping against the truck bed. "Have you told your mom? That you're staying somewhere?"

The question catches me off guard. I haven't talked to my mother in two years—not since I left. Haven't sent an address because I never had one worth sending. Haven't called because what would I say?

"No."

"Are you going to?"

"I don't know. Maybe." I pick at the truck bed's paint, flaking under my thumbnail. "What would I even say? 'Hey, I've been drifting for two years but I found a town in Colorado and I think I'm staying'?"

"Something like that. She's probably worried."

"She chose Jim. She made it clear where her priorities were."

"Parents make mistakes. Doesn't mean they stop caring." Harper pauses. "My dad asked about you again. Your plans, your intentions."

"What did you tell him?"

"That you're staying. That we're seeing what happens between us. That he doesn't have to approve but he has to accept it."

"How'd he take that?"

"Better than expected. Worse than I hoped." She smiles slightly. "He's protective. But he also trusts me to make my own choices, even when he disagrees with them."

We're quiet for a moment. Then Harper asks, "What does staying look like? Practically, I mean?"

"Frank's project starts first week of September. I'll need to find permanent housing—can't live in his spare room forever. Probably rent a room somewhere." I've been thinking about this. "Save money, maybe eventually get my own place. Build something stable."

"And us? What do we look like?"

The question I've been avoiding. "What do you want us to look like?"

"I asked first."

Fair enough. "I want to keep doing this. Spending time together, figuring things out, seeing where it goes." I look at her. "But I also know you're thinking about college. About leaving."

Harper's quiet for a long moment, staring out at the mountains. "I sent in an application to Berkeley. California. They have a good education program."

My stomach tightens. "California's far."

"I know."

"When did you apply?"

"Two weeks ago. Haven't told my parents yet." She glances at me. "Haven't told anyone except Carol Ann. And now you."

"Why Berkeley?"

"Because it's far from here. Because I want to see the ocean. Because I need to know who I am when I'm not the minister's daughter in a town where everyone's known me since I was six." She turns to face me fully. "Because you've made me brave enough to want things for myself."

The weight of that responsibility settles heavy. "Harper, I don't want to be the reason you—"

"You're not the reason. You're the catalyst." She takes my hand. "I've wanted to leave for years. You just showed me it was possible."

"Your parents will blame me."

"Probably. But that's not your fault." She squeezes my hand. "I'm seventeen. Almost eighteen. I get to make my own choices, even when they disappoint people."

"So you're leaving?" The words come out harder than I intend.

"I don't know yet. Berkeley might not accept me. My parents might refuse to help pay for it. I might chicken out." She pauses. "But I needed to try. Needed to at least apply. You taught me that—try even when it's scary."

We're both trying scary things. Me staying, her leaving. The irony isn't lost on either of us.

"What happens if you go to California and I'm here?"

"I don't know." Her honesty is brutal and refreshing. "Long distance? Summers together? Or maybe it ends and we're grateful for the time we had."

"That's not very romantic."

"No. But it's honest." She shifts closer. "Jesse, I can't promise you forever. I'm seventeen. I don't know what I want long-term. But I know I want right now. I know I want to see what we are when we're not counting down to September."

"And if you go to California?"

"Then we figure it out. Or we don't. But at least we'll have tried."

There it is again—that word. Try. Everyone keeps saying it. Try staying. Try trusting. Try building something even when you don't know if it'll last.

"This is really complicated," I say.

"Really complicated," Harper agrees. "You're staying, I might leave. We don't know what happens next. We can't promise anything long-term."

"Seems like maybe we shouldn't start something when there's so much uncertainty."

"Or maybe uncertainty is just part of it. Maybe nobody ever really knows what happens next and we're just honest enough to admit it." She leans against me. "My parents got married when they were twenty-one. They probably couldn't promise forever either. They just tried."

The sky's darkening now, first stars appearing. The evening star hangs low over the western mountains—the direction Harper might go, the direction I've always gone before Silver Ridge.

"Can I ask you something?" Harper's voice is quiet.

"Sure."

"Is there any version of this where you'd come with me? If I go to California?"

The question I've been dreading. The one I knew was coming but hoped wouldn't.

"I don't know," I admit. "I just decided to try staying somewhere. Leaving—even for you—feels like running again."

"I understand." There's no anger in her voice, just acceptance. "But I needed to ask."

We sit in silence. Two people who care about each other, trying to figure out if what they want is compatible or contradictory.

"Jesse?"

"Yeah?"

"Are you going to be sorry you stayed? If I leave for college and we end?"

That's the real question under everything. Will I regret taking this risk?

"No," I say, and I mean it. "Even if you go to California and we can't make it work, I won't be sorry I stayed. Because staying isn't just about you. It's about me proving I can do it. Finding out if I'm capable of building something instead of constantly leaving."

"That's good. That's really good." Harper sounds relieved. "Because I don't want to be your only reason. That's too much responsibility."

"You're not my only reason. But you're a big one."

"I'll take that."

We watch the last light fade from the sky, stars multiplying overhead. The town lights twinkle below like fallen stars. It's beautiful and peaceful and uncertain.

"Three weeks," Harper says again. "Then we find out what happens next."

"Then we find out."

She rests her head on my shoulder. "I'm glad you're staying."

"I'm glad you're brave enough to consider leaving."

"We're quite a pair."

"Yeah. We are."

The drive back to town is quiet but not uncomfortable. We're both processing, both thinking about the complications we've created. I'm staying, she might leave. We're trying something with no guarantee of success.

But we're trying.

At her house, Harper pauses before getting out.

"Thank you for being honest tonight. About not knowing if you could come with me. About staying being for you, not just for me."

"Thank you for asking. And for understanding."

She leans over, kisses my cheek—quick and sweet. "Night, Jesse."

"Night."

I watch her walk to her door, turn and wave before going inside. Then I drive back to Frank's house, thinking about Berkeley and staying and the question Harper asked that I couldn't answer.

Is there any version of this where I'd come with you?

I said I don't know. But the truth is more complicated.

The truth is, maybe. Eventually. If I prove to myself I can stay somewhere first. If I learn that leaving isn't my only option. If I build enough stability that choosing to go somewhere becomes different from running away.

But right now, I need to stay. Need to prove I can. Need to build something before I let myself consider leaving it.

Harper understands that. She understands that I need to do this, need to find out if staying is possible before I can consider anything else.

And that's why I love her.

That night, lying in Frank's spare room, I think about the question Harper didn't quite ask: will you wait for me if I go to California?

I don't know the answer to that either.

But I know we've got three weeks to figure out what we are before we decide what we might be.

And for now, that's enough.

Three weeks to see what happens when neither of us is running.

Three weeks to find out if love and uncertainty can coexist.

Three weeks to discover if trying is enough, even when success isn't guaranteed.

It's terrifying.

But it's also the bravest thing either of us has ever done.

And maybe bravery is enough.
