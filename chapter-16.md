# Chapter 16: Midpoint - She's Fallen Too

I was nursing a cup of coffee at the Silver Ridge Diner three days after my conversation with Harper at the overlook, trying not to think about the hurt in her eyes when I'd failed to answer her question about September. The coffee was bitter and I'd let it go lukewarm, but I kept my hands wrapped around the mug anyway, needing something to hold onto.

That's when Carol Ann Mitchell slid into the booth across from me.

I hadn't heard her approach, and the determined set of her jaw told me this wasn't a friendly chat. Carol Ann was Harper's best friend—had been since they were kids.

"We need to talk," she said, no preamble, no polite greeting.

I straightened in the booth. "Okay."

"About Harper." Carol Ann's eyes were sharp, protective. "And about what you're doing to her."

My stomach tightened. "I'm not trying to hurt her."

"Trying doesn't matter much when the result's the same." Carol Ann leaned forward, elbows on the Formica table. Around us, the diner hummed with afternoon activity—the clink of plates, low conversations, the jukebox playing something by The Platters. Nobody was paying us attention, but Carol Ann's intensity made the whole world narrow down to this booth.

"Harper's my best friend," she continued. "I've known her since we were six years old. I know when she's happy, when she's scared, when she's lying to herself." She paused, her gaze pinning me in place. "And I know when she's in love."

The words hit like a fist to the chest. I opened my mouth, closed it. "Carol Ann—"

"She's fallen for you, Jesse." Carol Ann's voice softened slightly, but the protectiveness remained. "Despite trying not to. Despite knowing you're leaving. Despite every smart, self-protective instinct telling her not to get attached to a boy who's already got one foot out the door."

I stared at the coffee mug, my throat tight. I'd known Harper cared about me. I'd felt it in the way she looked at me, the way she shared her dreams, the vulnerability in her voice when she asked about September. But hearing it stated plainly—that she'd *fallen* for me, that this wasn't just summer attraction but something deeper—made it real in a way I couldn't avoid.

"She's tried to protect herself," Carol Ann said. "Tried to keep perspective, remind herself you're temporary. But the heart doesn't work that way."

"I never meant—" I started, but Carol Ann cut me off.

"I know. But intention doesn't erase impact." She leaned back, crossing her arms. "If you're leaving anyway, you need to cut her loose *now*."

"Now?"

"Right now. Today." Carol Ann's expression was fierce. "Every day you stick around makes it harder when you go. Every conversation, every smile, every moment you spend together just digs the knife deeper. If you're leaving, the kindest thing you can do is leave her alone *now* so she can start getting over you."

The logic was sound. Brutal, but sound. Ripping off a bandage instead of peeling it slowly.

Except the thought of cutting Harper out of my life felt impossible. Even if it was for her own good.

"What if—" I stopped, not sure what I was asking.

"What if what?" Carol Ann prompted.

"What if I'm not sure about leaving?"

Something shifted in Carol Ann's expression. Not quite hope, but a softening around the edges. "Are you not sure?"

I dragged a hand through my hair, frustration and fear mixing in my chest. "I don't know. I don't know how to stay. I've been on the road for two years. Every place is temporary. Everyone I meet, I leave. That's what I do."

"That's what you've *done*," Carol Ann corrected. "Past tense. Doesn't mean it's what you have to keep doing."

"But what if I try to stay and can't?" The question came out raw. "What if I accept that I want her, commit to staying, and then six months from now I wake up needing the road again? What if I'm just built wrong for permanence?"

Carol Ann was quiet for a moment, studying me. The jukebox switched songs, something upbeat and cheerful that didn't match the weight in my chest.

"You're scared," she said finally.

"Yeah. I'm terrified."

"Of hurting her."

"Of hurting her worse than leaving now would." I met her eyes. "If I leave now, it hurts. I know that. But if I stay, make promises, let her believe in us, and *then* leave because I can't handle staying? That destroys her."

Carol Ann tilted her head, considering. "Or maybe you stay and discover you can handle it. Maybe you never had a good enough reason to stay before, and Harper's giving you that reason."

I wanted to believe that. But wanting something doesn't make it true.

"I don't have an answer," I admitted. "I don't know what to do."

"Then you need to figure it out." Carol Ann's voice turned hard again. "Because Harper deserves better than borrowed time. She deserves someone who can promise her more than 'maybe until September, maybe not even that long.' If you can't be that person, then let her go find someone who can."

The words stung because they were true. Harper deserved someone who could promise a future, someone who didn't flinch when plans extended past Labor Day.

"How much time do I have?" I asked quietly.

Carol Ann stood, smoothing her skirt. "I'm not giving you a deadline, Jesse. But the festival's in a few weeks, and everyone knows you planned to leave by September. The town's watching. Her parents are watching. And Harper's heart is breaking a little more every day you stay without committing or leave without explaining." She looked down at me, and her expression held both challenge and something like pity. "Whatever you're going to do, decide soon. For her sake."

She walked away, leaving me alone in the booth with cold coffee and the weight of her words pressing on my chest.

Around me, the diner continued its normal rhythm. A waitress refilled coffee at the counter. A couple in the corner booth laughed over milkshakes. The jukebox played on. The world kept turning, oblivious to the fact that mine had just tilted sideways.

Harper loved me.

Not just cared about me or enjoyed my company. She'd *fallen* for me. The girl who made me feel like home could be more than a word—she loved me.

And I was going to break her heart.

The realization settled in my bones like winter cold. Whether I left or stayed, whether I ran or risked staying, I was going to hurt her. If I left, the pain would be immediate and clean—or as clean as heartbreak ever is. If I stayed and failed at it, the pain would be worse, deeper, the kind that comes from betrayed trust and broken promises.

But if I stayed and *didn't* fail...

I shut that thought down fast. Hope was dangerous. I'd learned that when my stepfather made it clear I was unwanted.

Except Harper didn't make me feel unwanted. She made me feel like I mattered.

I thought about the overlook, how she'd asked if there was any version of September where I stayed, and I'd choked on the answer. I thought about the hurt that flashed across her face when I deflected, the way she'd tried to hide it but couldn't quite manage. I thought about Carol Ann's words: *She's fallen for you despite every smart instinct telling her not to.*

Harper had been brave. She'd risked her heart knowing I was temporary, had let herself feel something real despite the guaranteed expiration date. And what had I done? Pulled away. Created distance. Tried to protect both of us by protecting neither of us.

The coffee had gone completely cold. I pushed the mug away and dropped a few coins on the table for the waitress.

Outside, the afternoon sun beat down on Main Street. My truck sat in the angled parking, beat-up and reliable, ready to take me anywhere I wanted to go. For two years, that truck had been home, freedom, safety. It meant I could leave whenever things got complicated or uncomfortable or too real.

But sitting in the diner booth with Carol Ann's words echoing in my head, I realized my truck had also been a prison. As long as I could leave, I never had to risk staying. As long as I kept moving, I never had to test whether I could build something permanent. As long as I told myself I was protecting people by not getting too attached, I never had to face the possibility that I was really just protecting myself.

Harper had given me what I'd wanted since leaving home two years ago: someone who saw me, valued me, made me feel like I belonged somewhere. She'd given me hope that home could be a person, not just a place. She'd given me the terrifying, beautiful possibility that maybe I wasn't broken beyond repair.

And I was about to throw it all away because I was too scared to try.

I stood on the sidewalk outside the diner, the August heat pressing down, and admitted the truth I'd been avoiding: I didn't want to leave Harper. I didn't want to get in my truck and drive away from Silver Ridge, from Frank's quiet approval and Danny's friendship and the community center kids who'd started to trust me. I didn't want to go back to anonymous motels and temporary jobs and the loneliness of always being the new guy who'd be gone in a few months.

I wanted to stay.

But wanting and being able to were two different things. And I had less than a month to figure out which one would win.

I walked back toward Frank's house, my hands shoved in my pockets, Carol Ann's question ringing in my ears: *What are you going to do about it?*

I still didn't have an answer. But for the first time, I understood the full weight of what I was choosing between. It wasn't just my fear versus my desire. It was Harper's heart in the balance, and whether I was brave enough to be worthy of the trust she'd placed in me.

The midpoint of summer had arrived, and I'd reached the crisis I'd been running toward since the day I drove into Silver Ridge. Harper loved me. I loved her—though I hadn't let myself say it even in the privacy of my own thoughts until now. And time was running out for me to decide whether love was enough to make me stay.

I didn't know the answer yet.

But I knew I couldn't keep avoiding the question.
