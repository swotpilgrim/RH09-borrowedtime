# Chapter 17: Trying to Let Her Go

I decided the kindest thing I could do was create distance.

After my conversation with Carol Ann, I told myself I was being merciful. Pulling back now would hurt less than staying close until September ripped us apart.

So I took extra shifts with Frank's crew.

"You sure?" Frank asked the first time, squinting at me in the morning light at the construction site. "You've been working hard all summer. Don't need to run yourself into the ground."

"I could use the money," I said, which was true enough. "And I don't mind the work."

Frank studied me for a long moment, and I had the uncomfortable feeling he saw right through my excuse. But he nodded. "Suit yourself."

The extra hours meant I could skip afternoon sessions at the community center. When Harper asked if I'd be there later, I'd shake my head, apologetic. "Frank needs me on site."

"Oh." Her smile faltered. "That's okay."

But I saw the confusion in her eyes: *Why now? Why suddenly so busy?*

I couldn't answer without admitting I was running scared.

The few times I did make it to the center, I kept our interactions brief. Professional. When Harper asked if I wanted to grab milkshakes after we finished, I claimed I was tired from the long day. When she mentioned a new hiking trail she'd found, I said I probably didn't have time this week.

"Maybe next week?" she offered, hope in her voice.

"Maybe," I said, knowing next week I'd find another excuse.

A week into this pattern, Harper's confusion shifted to hurt. She stopped asking questions. Stopped suggesting plans. When we were at the center together, she gave the kids all the warmth she used to share with me.

With me, she was polite. Distant.

I told myself this was what I wanted. Creating distance to protect us both.

It felt like punishment.

"You're being an idiot," Danny said bluntly one afternoon at the construction site. We were taking a water break, sitting in the shade of Frank's truck. August heat shimmered off the pavement, and sweat plastered my shirt to my back.

"Thanks for the observation," I muttered.

"I'm serious, Jesse." Danny took a long drink from his canteen. "Whatever you're doing with Harper—it's not working."

"I'm just busy."

Danny snorted. "Too busy for a milkshake or a walk?"

I didn't answer.

"Carol Ann says Harper's miserable," Danny continued. "Says she comes home from the center almost in tears some days. Says Harper thinks she did something wrong, that she drove you away somehow."

Guilt twisted in my stomach. "She didn't do anything wrong."

"Then why are you treating her like she's got the plague?"

"I'm not—" I stopped, frustration building. "Look, you don't understand."

"So explain it to me."

I set the water bottle down carefully. "I'm leaving in a few weeks. The longer I stay close to Harper, the harder it'll be. I'm trying to make it easier."

Danny was quiet for a moment. Then he shook his head. "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard."

"Excuse me?"

"You think ignoring her makes leaving easier? You're just hurting her *now* instead of later." Danny's expression was frustrated. "If you're gonna leave, at least spend the time you've got left with her. Make good memories instead of this miserable avoidance."

"And make it hurt worse when I go?"

"It's already gonna hurt, Jesse. You can't avoid that. But at least if you're together now, you'll both have something good to remember. This?" He gestured vaguely. "This is just making everyone miserable for no reason."

I wanted to argue. Wanted to explain the whole chain of disaster: staying close would make me want to stay, wanting would lead to trying, trying would end in failure.

But I didn't say any of that. Danny wouldn't understand, and I was too tired to fight.

"I need to get back to work," I said instead, standing.

Danny caught my arm. "Jesse. I know you're scared. But you're being a coward about it."

The words stung because they were true. I pulled my arm free and walked back to the construction site without responding.

That evening, I went to the community center. I told myself I was just checking in, fulfilling Frank's requirement that I volunteer. But really, I needed to see Harper. Needed to know if Danny was right about how miserable she was.

She was in the main room when I arrived, helping two little girls with a craft project. Her voice was warm and encouraging as she showed them how to cut construction paper, her hands gentle as she guided theirs.

Then she looked up and saw me.

The warmth drained from her expression so fast it was like watching a light switch off. She didn't frown or glare—that would have been better, somehow. Instead, her face went carefully neutral, polite and distant as a stranger's.

"Jesse," she said evenly. "I thought you were working late."

"Finished early," I said, my throat tight. "Thought I'd stop by."

"That's nice." She turned back to the girls. "Okay, sweethearts, you're doing great. Keep cutting along that line."

I stood there awkwardly, waiting for her to say something else. Ask how I'd been. Mention the weather. Anything to acknowledge that two weeks ago we'd been close, that we'd meant something to each other.

But she just focused on the craft project, her attention entirely on the kids.

I drifted over to the basketball court where some boys were shooting hoops. For the next hour, I supervised half-heartedly, my attention constantly drawn back to Harper. I watched her move through the room, warm and engaged with every kid, every parent who stopped to chat.

With me, nothing. Not coldness, exactly. Just absence. Like I'd become invisible.

One of the mothers commented on how wonderful Harper was with the children, and Harper smiled that genuine smile I'd fallen for. "I love these kids," she said simply.

I remembered when she used to smile at me like that.

When the session ended and parents collected their kids, I helped stack chairs while Harper organized supplies. We worked in silence, moving around each other like polite strangers.

Finally, I couldn't take it anymore.

"Harper."

She looked up from the bin of crayons she was sorting. "Yes?"

"Did I—" I stopped, not sure how to phrase the question. "Did I do something wrong?"

Her expression didn't change. "No. Why would you think that?"

"You seem..." I gestured helplessly. "Different. With me."

"Do I?" She closed the crayon bin with a soft click. "I'm just being realistic, Jesse. Following your lead."

The words hit like a slap. My lead. Because I'd pulled away first, and she was just matching my energy.

"I didn't mean to—"

"Didn't mean to what?" She finally looked directly at me, and the hurt in her eyes was devastating. "You've been busy. Working hard. I understand that. I'm not upset."

But she was. I could see it in the tightness around her mouth, the careful control in her voice. She was upset, and she was trying hard not to show it because I'd made her feel like she didn't have the right to be.

"Harper, I—" I didn't know how to finish that sentence. I'm sorry? That wasn't enough. I was trying to protect you? That sounded hollow even in my head.

"It's fine." She picked up the crayon bin. "I need to put these away."

She walked past me toward the storage closet, and I stood there in the middle of the empty community center, feeling like the worst kind of fool.

This was what I'd wanted, wasn't it? Distance. Protection. Making leaving easier.

So why did it feel like I'd made everything infinitely worse?

I left the center and drove back to Frank's house as dusk settled over Silver Ridge. Frank was on the porch when I arrived, sitting in his usual chair with a cup of coffee.

He looked at me as I climbed the steps, and something in my expression must have shown because he shook his head slowly.

"What?" I asked defensively.

"Nothing." Frank took a sip of coffee. "Just disappointing to watch, is all."

"Watch what?"

"You hurting that girl and calling it kindness."

I froze on the top step. "I'm not trying to hurt her."

"Trying doesn't matter much when the result's the same." Frank's voice was mild, but his eyes were sharp. "You're doing to her what was done to you—pushing her away, making her feel unwanted. Difference is, you're doing it on purpose."

The observation cut deep. "That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Frank set his coffee down. "Your stepfather made you feel like you weren't worth keeping around. Now you're making that girl feel the same way. How's that different?"

"I'm leaving," I said, frustration rising. "I'm going to leave anyway, so creating distance now is merciful. It's better than—"

"Better than what? Better than actually caring? Better than being honest?" Frank's tone stayed even, but disappointment radiated from him. "Son, I've watched you all summer fall for that girl. And I've watched her fall for you. Now you're running scared, and instead of admitting it, you're pretending you're doing her a favor."

"You don't understand—"

"I understand plenty." Frank stood, picking up his coffee cup. "I understand you're terrified of staying because you might fail at it. But you're guaranteeing failure by running. And you're hurting a good girl in the process." He paused at the door. "Think about whether that's the man you want to be."

He went inside, leaving me alone on the porch as night fell over the mountains.

I sat down in the chair Frank had vacated, still warm from his presence, and admitted the truth I'd been avoiding: my attempt to protect Harper had only hurt her faster. I'd created the pain I was trying to prevent, just shifted the timeline.

Danny was right. Frank was right. Hell, even Carol Ann was right.

I was being an idiot. A coward. Hurting someone I cared about because I was too scared to risk getting hurt myself.

The distance I'd created hadn't protected either of us. It had just made us both miserable while wasting the time we had left.

And the worst part? I didn't know how to undo the damage without admitting why I'd done it in the first place. Without confessing that I was terrified of staying, terrified of leaving, terrified of every possible future because they all led to pain.

I sat on Frank's porch watching stars emerge over Silver Ridge, and I'd never felt more lost.
