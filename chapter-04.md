# Chapter 4: Community Center Volunteer

I show up at the community center at quarter to two. The building looks different in afternoon light than it did Sunday morning—less formal, more welcoming. I can hear kids' voices echoing from inside.

The main room has been transformed. The folding chairs from Sunday service are stacked against the walls. In their place: tables covered with craft supplies, a record player in one corner, sports equipment near the back door. Maybe twenty kids ranging from about six to fourteen run around, their energy filling every corner.

Harper stands in the middle of it all like the calm center of a storm.

She's wearing blue jeans and a white blouse with the sleeves rolled up, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail. No Sunday dress and gloves today—she looks ready to work. As I watch, she crouches down to help a little girl who's struggling with a tangle of yarn, her voice patient and encouraging.

"That's it, Jenny. Just pull this loop through... perfect! See, you've got it."

The girl beams and runs off to show her friend, and Harper straightens, scanning the room with the practiced eye of someone who's learned to track multiple moving targets at once. Her gaze lands on me and she smiles, waving me over.

"Jesse! You made it."

"Said I would."

"I know, but I've learned not to count on volunteers showing up until they actually walk through the door." She gestures around the room. "Welcome to controlled chaos. We've got craft time until three, then we move outside for games and sports. Think you can handle it?"

"I can try."

"That's all I ask." She glances at a group of boys roughhousing near the craft table. "Tommy! Marcus! If you're going to wrestle, take it outside. Inside is for inside voices and inside activities."

The boys separate immediately, sheepish but not resentful. Harper has a way of correcting without scolding that makes kids want to behave for her.

"How do you do that?" I ask.

"Do what?"

"Get them to listen without having to yell."

She considers the question seriously. "I think they listen better when you talk to them like people instead of at them like problems. Also, consistency helps. They know what I expect."

A crash from the far corner makes us both turn. A boy of maybe ten stands frozen next to a toppled shelf, art supplies scattered across the floor.

Harper's already moving. "It's okay, Michael. Accidents happen. Let's clean it up together."

The boy's shoulders drop with relief. Harper helps him right the shelf, talking quietly.

I find myself watching her more than I should. The easy way she moves through the room, how she remembers every kid's name, the warmth in her voice.

"Jesse?" Harper's back beside me, pulling me from my observations. "You okay with fixing things?"

"What kind of things?"

"The basketball hoop outside has a loose board. There's a shelf in the supply closet that's wobbling. And the record player skips."

"I can take a look."

"Tools are in the closet near the back door."

I find a basic toolkit and start with the shelf—just needs the brackets tightened. The record player's a loose belt. By three o'clock when Harper herds the kids outside, both repairs are done.

I follow them out to the yard behind the community center. There's a basketball court with faded lines, an open field, and the basketball hoop Harper mentioned. The loose board is obvious—the whole backboard shifts when you touch it.

"All right, everyone!" Harper claps her hands and the kids gather around her like she's a magnet. "We're doing relay races today. I need two team captains... Sarah and Marcus, you're up. Pick your teams."

The kids sort themselves with the seriousness of professional athletes. Harper catches my eye and mouths "basketball hoop" with a grateful smile.

I grab a ladder and the toolkit. The hoop's fixable—just needs the mounting bracket secured and bolts tightened. I'm halfway through when a voice pipes up from below.

"Are you Harper's boyfriend?"

I look down. A kid maybe seven stares up at me with wide, curious eyes. A few other kids have stopped their relay race to listen.

"No. I'm just helping out."

"But you're fixing stuff for her."

"I'm helping at the community center."

"Do you like Harper?" A girl this time, with pigtails and a gap-toothed grin.

"Harper's nice," I say carefully.

"She's real pretty," the first boy says. "Are you gonna marry her?"

"I'm just visiting for the summer. Shouldn't you kids be racing?"

"Harper!" one of them yells. "Is Jesse your boyfriend?"

I freeze on the ladder. Harper jogs over, and I can't tell if she heard the question or just noticed the kids have abandoned the race.

"What's going on over here?"

"We were just asking if Jesse's your boyfriend," Pigtails says with the complete lack of filter that makes children both endearing and terrifying.

Harper laughs—easy and genuine, not embarrassed. "Jesse's new in town and helping out for the summer. He's being very nice fixing our basketball hoop so you kids can play later."

"But do you like him?" Gap-Tooth persists.

"I like everyone who volunteers to spend their afternoon with you wild things. Now back to your teams—Sarah's team is winning and I know Marcus's team wants a rematch."

The kids scatter with the short attention span of the young, crisis averted. Harper glances up at me on the ladder, and I catch something in her expression—amusement, maybe, or embarrassment she's hiding better than I expected.

"Sorry about that. Kids have no boundaries."

"It's fine."

"They mean well. They just..." She trails off, watching me tighten the final bolt. "They want everyone to be happy like in their storybooks, where people meet and fall in love and everything works out. Romance is simpler when you're seven."

"Guess so."

I climb down and test the hoop. Solid now. Harper bounces a basketball a few times, then takes a shot. It swishes through the net and she grins.

"Perfect. Thank you. This has been broken for weeks."

"Not a big fix."

"Maybe not for you." She catches the ball. "But you just saved me three phone calls and a lecture about being careful on ladders."

A shriek from the relay course catches her attention. When she looks back, there's warmth in her eyes that makes something in my chest tighten.

"You're good at this. Being helpful without making it a big deal." She pauses. "You just see what's needed and fix it. That's rare."

I don't know what to say, so I just shrug and start gathering tools. Harper calls the kids back, organizing them for basketball. I watch as she divides them into teams, teaching the younger ones to dribble, letting the older ones scrimmage while she referees.

She's good with them. Not just patient—genuinely engaged, like she cares about each kid individually instead of managing them as a group. When a quiet boy makes his first basket, she high-fives him with enthusiasm that makes his face light up. When two girls start arguing over a foul, she listens to both sides and helps them work it out fairly.

The afternoon passes like that—me doing small repairs and organizing the indoor space while Harper runs the kids through various activities outside. At five o'clock parents start arriving for pickup, and Harper walks each kid out, telling the parents something specific and positive about their child's afternoon.

By five-thirty the last kid is gone and the building is finally quiet.

Harper collapses dramatically into a folding chair in the main room, blowing a strand of hair out of her face.

"I love those kids but they're exhausting."

I'm putting away the last of the craft supplies, organizing them in bins the way I noticed they'd been arranged. "You're good with them."

"I've had practice. Been doing this for three summers now." She watches me sort the supplies. "You don't have to organize everything. Just getting it off the tables is enough."

"It's faster to find things if they're organized."

"Spoken like someone who's worked a lot of different jobs." She stands and starts helping, working beside me to clear the last table. "My dad mentioned you've been traveling for a couple years. Do you like it?"

It's the second time she's asked me that question—not where I've been or what I've done, but whether I actually like the lifestyle I've chosen.

"It has its advantages."

"That's not really an answer."

"No," I admit. "It's not."

She doesn't push, just nods like she understands something I haven't said out loud. We work in comfortable silence for a few minutes, finishing the cleanup.

"Will you be back Wednesday?" she asks as we're heading toward the door. "This is Monday-Wednesday-Friday. Sports and outdoor activities."

"I'll be here."

"Good." She holds the door open and I step out into the late afternoon sunshine. "Really, thank you for today. For fixing things and helping and being patient with the kids' questions about... everything."

She's thinking about the boyfriend question, I can tell. I should probably address it, make it clear I'm just helping out, nothing more. But before I can figure out how to say that without making it awkward, she's already continuing.

"See you Wednesday, Jesse."

"See you."

I walk to my truck parked on the street, very aware that she's still standing in the doorway watching me leave. I don't let myself look back.

The drive to Frank's house takes five minutes. The whole way I think about Harper's smile when I fixed the basketball hoop. The way she laughed off the kids' questions without seeming bothered. How she asked if I liked traveling like the answer actually mattered to her.

The way she thanked me for being helpful without making it a big deal, like she understood that's how I prefer to move through the world—useful but unnoticed.

I park in Frank's driveway and sit in the truck for a minute, hands on the steering wheel, trying to figure out why one afternoon at the community center feels more significant than it should.

She's the minister's daughter. I'm leaving in September. Helping out at the center is just fulfilling Frank's condition for room and board.

That's all it is.

But I'm still thinking about her smile when I walk into Frank's house.

Still thinking about it when I lie in bed that night, the spare room dark and quiet.

Still thinking about it when I finally fall asleep.
