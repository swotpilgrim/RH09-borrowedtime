# Chapter 5: Keeping Distance

By my second week in Silver Ridge, I've settled into a rhythm. Wake at five-thirty. Coffee with Frank. Construction site by six. Work through morning heat, lunch with the crew, back to work until three. Quick shower. Community center by two-thirty most afternoons. Evening alone with a paperback and my transistor radio. Asleep by ten.

It's the kind of routine I usually avoid. Routines mean staying, and staying means getting comfortable, and getting comfortable means it hurts more when you leave.

But three months isn't long enough to count as really staying.

That's what I tell myself, anyway.

"You settling in all right?" Danny asks on Thursday afternoon. We're carrying two-by-fours from the truck to the building site, working in tandem the way we've started to without needing to coordinate.

"Yeah, it's fine."

"Frank treating you okay? He can be kind of gruff."

"He's all right. Doesn't talk much, but that suits me."

Danny laughs. "Yeah, Frank's never been big on conversation. My dad says he's been that way since high school. Just a quiet guy who does good work and minds his own business."

We set down the lumber and head back for another load. The June sun beats down hot enough that we've both shed our shirts, working in undershirts dark with sweat. The air smells like sawdust and pine sap.

"You want to grab a beer after work?" Danny asks. "Thursday's my usual night at Murphy's."

It's the third time Danny's invited me. But Danny's been nothing but friendly for two weeks straight, never pushing. There's something genuine about him that makes it hard to keep all my walls up.

"Maybe next week."

"Sure. Standing invitation." Danny hoists another bundle of boards. "Carol Ann keeps asking when she's going to meet you. Thinks I made you up."

I almost smile. "She sounds practical."

"She is. It's one of the things I love about her." Danny says it easily, like love is simple. "You really never had a steady girl?"

"No home to have someone back at."

"Right, the traveling thing." He pauses. "But didn't you grow up somewhere? Before you started moving around?"

I should've known the questions would come eventually. People always want to know where you're from, where you're going, why you don't just settle down.

"California originally. Left when I was sixteen."

"Family still there?"

"My mother is. She remarried. New husband didn't really want me around, so I cleared out."

Danny's quiet for a moment, and I brace for pity or awkward sympathy. Instead he just nods.

"That's rough, man. My family drives me crazy sometimes, but at least I know they want me around." He slaps my shoulder briefly. "Well, Silver Ridge wants you around while you're here. That's something."

It's a kind thing to say, made kinder by the fact that he doesn't belabor it. Just states it like fact and moves on.

That afternoon I head to the community center at two-thirty. Wednesday means sports and outdoor activities, and when I walk in Harper's already organizing kids into teams for kickball.

She's wearing blue jeans rolled at the ankles and a red gingham shirt tied at the waist, her hair in a ponytail that swings when she turns. She spots me and waves.

"Jesse! Perfect timing. Can you referee kickball while I set up the relay course?"

"I don't really know the rules."

"Neither do half these kids. Just make sure nobody gets hurt and call obviously terrible kicks foul." She's already moving toward the storage closet. "And don't let Tommy argue with you—he'll try. He argues with everyone."

I end up in the yard with twelve kids trying to remember kickball rules. It's chaotic and loud, with disputed calls every other kick.

Tommy, true to Harper's warning, argues every call.

"That wasn't foul!"

"Your whole foot was over the line."

"Only because Mark's pitching is crooked!"

"Boys." I use the voice I learned working construction—firm but not angry. "Tommy, you were foul. Mark, pitch it straight. Next kicker."

They grumble but comply. When Harper comes back fifteen minutes later, everyone's still playing and nobody's crying.

"You're a natural," she says.

"I just prevented bloodshed."

"With this group, that's an accomplishment."

She takes over the game and I move to setting up the relay course she sketched out—cones marking turns, a finish line drawn in chalk. Simple work that doesn't require much thought, which is good because my thoughts keep drifting to Harper.

The way she referees the kickball game with patience and humor. How she remembers which kids are good at sports and which ones need extra encouragement. The sound of her laugh when one of the littler kids kicks the ball backward by accident.

I shouldn't be noticing these things. Shouldn't be cataloguing them like they matter.

She's just the minister's daughter who runs the youth programs. I'm just fulfilling Frank's condition for room and board. We're both doing our jobs, that's all.

After the relay races, Harper sends older kids to basketball while helping younger ones with crafts inside. I end up at a table with a girl building something from popsicle sticks.

"What are you making?"

"A house. For my dollies." She squints at the leaning structure. "But it keeps falling."

"You need a stronger foundation." I show her how to reinforce the base. "If the bottom's solid, the rest will hold."

Harper appears with glue bottles and pauses, watching us.

"What?" I ask.

"You're good with them. Helping Emma without taking over."

"Just showing her how."

"Exactly. That's teaching, not just helping." She looks pleased. "A lot of people don't get the difference."

She moves on, and I'm left feeling oddly exposed.

At five o'clock the last kids get picked up and Harper collapses into a chair dramatically.

"I love Wednesdays but they're exhausting. All that running around in the sun."

I'm stacking chairs against the wall, putting the room back in order. "You do this three days a week?"

"Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Plus Sunday school on Sundays, and I help my mom with choir practice Tuesday nights." She stretches her arms over her head. "Keeps me busy."

"Doesn't leave much time for yourself."

"I don't mind. I like being busy. Idle hands and all that." She grins. "What about you? What do you do when you're not working construction or volunteering?"

"Not much. Read, mostly."

"What kind of books?"

"Whatever I can find. Westerns, mysteries, sometimes science fiction."

"Have you read much Steinbeck?" When I nod, her face lights up. "I love Steinbeck. East of Eden is one of my favorite books."

"Haven't read that one."

"Oh, you have to! It's incredible. Lots of traveling, actually—people moving around California looking for something better." She pauses. "I guess that's kind of like what you've been doing."

"I guess."

"Where did you say you were from originally?"

The question is casual, genuinely curious. Not prying, just interested. But I've learned to be careful with personal information. Too many details make you memorable, and memorable means people ask more questions when you leave.

"Different places. I've moved around a lot."

"But where did you grow up? Before the traveling?"

"California. Then I left."

"Just left? At eighteen?"

"Sixteen."

Her eyebrows raise slightly but she doesn't look shocked or judgmental. Just thoughtful. "That's young to be on your own."

"Old enough to work. Old enough to take care of myself."

"I didn't mean—" She stops, seeming to reconsider her words. "I just meant it must have been hard. Being sixteen and figuring everything out alone."

"You get used to it."

"That's not the same as it being easy."

It's the second time she's called me on that distinction. I said I was used to traveling and she pointed out that wasn't the same as liking it. Now she's pointing out that getting used to being alone doesn't mean it was easy.

She sees the difference between adaptation and preference. Most people don't.

"It was fine," I say, more defensively than I intend. "Better than staying somewhere I wasn't wanted."

"I wasn't criticizing. Just... I can't imagine leaving Silver Ridge at sixteen. This is all I've ever known." She looks around the community center, her expression wistful. "Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to just go somewhere completely different. See something new."

"It's interesting at first. New places, new people."

"But?"

"But it's also lonely. Never really belonging anywhere."

The words come out before I can stop them, more honest than I meant to be. Harper's eyes find mine, and there's understanding in them that makes my chest tight.

"Do you like it? The traveling, being on your own?"

There it is again. That question. Not what I've done or where I've been, but whether I actually like the life I've chosen.

"I'm used to it," I say, falling back on the safe answer.

"Jesse." She says my name gently. "That's still not the same thing."

"I know."

We look at each other for a moment, something passing between us that feels significant. Then Harper glances at the clock and stands.

"I should lock up. My parents expect me home for dinner."

I help her close windows and turn off lights. We walk out together into the June evening, the air cooling now that the sun's lower.

"Thanks for today," Harper says. "For helping with the kids and fixing Emma's house foundation and refereeing Tommy's arguments."

"Just what I was here for."

"Maybe. But you do it well." She pauses by her car—a sensible blue sedan, probably her father's car she borrows. "I'll see you Friday?"

"Yeah. Friday."

She drives off with a wave, and I walk to my truck parked on the street.

On the drive back to Frank's house, I think about Harper's questions. How she asked if I liked traveling, if it was easy being alone young. How she pushed gently for truth underneath surface answers.

Most people don't push. Harper seems to actually want to know—not to judge or pity, just to understand.

That's dangerous.

Understanding leads to connection, connection leads to caring, caring leads to pain when I leave.

I need to be more careful. Keep more distance.

But even as I think it, I know I won't. There's something about Harper's genuine curiosity that makes me want to answer honestly.

That night I lie awake longer than usual, staring at the water stain on the ceiling.

Harper Wells is dangerous to my carefully maintained distance.

And I'm not sure I want to maintain that distance anymore.
