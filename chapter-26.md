# Chapter 26: Finding Her

I woke up Sunday morning in Frank's spare room with sunlight streaming through the window and certainty in my chest.

My duffel bag sat on the chair, still packed from yesterday's plan to leave.

I got up, unzipped it, and started unpacking. Clothes back in drawers. The book Danny had lent me on the nightstand where it belonged. The coffee mug from the diner in the kitchen.

Unpacking a life instead of packing one.

Frank was already up, sitting on the porch with his morning coffee when I came outside.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning." I sat in the other chair. "About that Jensen Construction job..."

"Still available if you want it."

"I want it."

Frank nodded, the smallest smile crossing his face. "Good. I'll make the call tomorrow. They'll want to meet you, but with my recommendation, you're as good as hired."

"Thank you. For everything. For giving me the summer, for being patient while I figured my shit out, for—"

"You're family, Jesse." Frank cut me off. "That's what family does."

The words hit hard. Family. He'd called me family.

"I need to find a place to live," I said. "Can't stay in your spare room forever."

"No rush. But old Mrs. Henderson has a garage apartment she rents out. Furnished, month-to-month. Might be worth looking at."

"I'll check it out."

We sat in comfortable silence, drinking coffee, watching Silver Ridge wake up.

"You talk to Harper?" Frank asked eventually.

"Last night. At the festival."

"And?"

"And I told her I'm staying. That I'm sorry. That I love her." I stared into my coffee mug. "She said she needs time. To trust that it's real."

"Sensible girl."

"Yeah."

"You gonna give her that time?"

"Yeah. And I'm gonna prove it's real. Day by day."

Frank nodded approval. "That's the way."

After breakfast, I drove to the community center. Sunday morning, before services started. The building was quiet, but I knew Harper would be there—she always came early to set up for the youth program.

Her car was in the lot.

I found her in the main room, arranging chairs. She looked up when I entered, surprise flashing across her face.

"Jesse. What are you doing here?"

I held up a toolbox I'd borrowed from Frank. "Remember how the basketball hoop's been wobbly? Thought I'd fix it."

She blinked. "Now?"

"Unless you need the space."

"No, I... go ahead."

I got to work on the hoop while Harper continued setting up. We didn't talk much, just existed in the same space. But it felt different from the careful distance of the past weeks. Less tension. More possibility.

After I finished with the hoop, I noticed the supply closet door was sticking. Fixed that too. Then the window blind that wouldn't roll up properly.

Small things. But things that needed doing.

"You're fixing everything," Harper observed, watching me work on the blind.

"Just the things that are broken."

"Is that a metaphor?"

I looked at her. "Maybe. Is it working?"

A smile tugged at her lips. "Maybe."

The main doors opened and families started arriving for the Sunday program. Harper greeted them with her usual warmth, and I stayed out of the way, finishing up the repairs.

But when the session started and the kids saw me, they swarmed.

"Mr. Jesse! You came back!"

"Did you go to the festival?"

"Are you gonna help us today?"

I looked to Harper, uncertain if she wanted me there. She met my eyes, considered for a moment, then nodded.

"Yeah," I told the kids. "I'm gonna help."

The morning passed in familiar rhythm. Supervising basketball games, helping with craft projects, making sure nobody got hurt or fought too much. Things I'd done all summer. Things I'd missed doing this past week.

After the session ended and the last family left, Harper and I cleaned up together.

"You didn't have to come today," she said, stacking chairs.

"I know."

"But you did anyway."

"I said I was staying. This is part of staying." I grabbed a broom. "Besides, I missed the kids."

"They missed you too." Harper collected abandoned craft supplies. "Tommy asked me every day this week if you were coming back."

"What did you tell him?"

"That I didn't know."

We worked in silence for a few minutes.

"Jesse?"

"Yeah?"

"What you said last night. About this being trauma, not truth. About choosing to leave before being left." She paused, holding a stack of construction paper. "That took courage. To see that about yourself. To admit it."

"Or it took watching you be brave enough that I couldn't keep being a coward."

She set down the paper, turned to face me fully. "I've been thinking about what you said. About needing time to trust this is real."

My heart hammered. "Okay."

"And you're right. I do need that. But..." She took a breath. "I also think I need to tell you what I need. To see. To believe you're really staying."

"Tell me."

"Consistency. Not grand gestures. Just... showing up. Being here. Doing the work. The boring, everyday work of being part of this community."

"I can do that."

"And communication. When you're scared, when you're struggling, when the road calls you—you have to tell me. Not pull away like you did before."

"I will."

"And time. You're going to have to give me time to believe this is real. To trust that you won't change your mind."

"As much time as you need."

She studied me. "You're really serious about this."

"Dead serious."

"Okay." She picked up the construction paper again. "Then prove it. Show me."

"Starting now."

Over the next week, I did exactly that.

Monday, I met with Jensen Construction. Got hired on the spot with Frank's recommendation. Permanent position, good pay, benefits starting after ninety days. I signed the paperwork and called Harper to tell her.

Tuesday, I looked at Mrs. Henderson's garage apartment. Small—one room with a kitchenette and a bathroom—but furnished and clean. Month-to-month lease. I took it, moved my stuff in that afternoon. When Harper drove by and saw my truck parked there instead of Frank's driveway, she stopped.

"You got a place."

"Yeah. Want to see it?"

She came inside, looked around the small space. "It's good."

"It's not much, but it's mine. First time I've rented a place instead of just staying in my truck or a motel."

She ran her hand along the small kitchen counter. "It's real. You having a place. A lease."

"Yeah. It is."

Wednesday, I started at Jensen Construction. Hard work, good crew, steady paycheck. Frank stopped by the site to check on me, pride clear in his expression.

Thursday, I came to the community center after work. Not because Harper expected me, but because I wanted to. Helped with the afternoon session, stayed to clean up after.

Friday, Danny and Carol Ann invited me and Harper to a double date at the drive-in. Harper hesitated, looked at me.

"Only if you want to," I said.

"Okay," she said finally. "Okay."

We went. Sat in Danny's car, shared popcorn, watched the movie. Harper kept a careful distance between us, but she laughed at the funny parts and didn't pull away when my arm brushed hers.

Saturday, I unpacked the last box in my apartment and realized I'd done it. Actually stayed somewhere long enough to unpack.

Sunday, I went to church with Frank. Sat in the pew, listened to Reverend Wells preach, felt the weight of the community around me. After service, the Reverend shook my hand.

"Heard you took the Jensen job. And got yourself an apartment."

"Yes, sir."

"Glad you're staying, Jesse."

"Thank you, sir."

That afternoon, Harper and I walked to the overlook. Our first time back since that night she'd asked if there was any version of September where I stayed.

We stood looking out over the valley, the mountains rising around us.

"A week ago," Harper said quietly, "I thought you'd be gone by now."

"A week ago, I thought I would be too."

"What changed? Really?"

I thought about it. "I stopped asking if I could stay and started asking if I wanted to. And the answer was yes. So clearly yes that everything else became noise."

"You're not scared anymore?"

"I'm terrified. Every day I wake up scared I'll fail at this. But I'm more scared of the alternative. Of leaving and never knowing if I could've made it work."

Harper reached for my hand, the first time she'd initiated contact since our fight. I laced my fingers through hers, trying to keep my hand from shaking.

"This week," she said. "Watching you show up. Get the job. Move into your apartment. Come to the center even when I didn't ask. Go to church. Be part of things." She squeezed my hand. "It helped. To see you actually doing it. Not just saying it."

"I'm going to keep doing it. This is who I am now. Someone who stays."

She turned to face me. "I'm starting to believe you."

"Good. Because I'm not going anywhere."

"Jesse?"

"Yeah?"

"Can I kiss you?"

My heart stopped. "Are you sure?"

"I'm sure."

I cupped her face gently, giving her time to change her mind, to pull away. But she didn't. She leaned in, and when our lips met it felt like coming home.

The kiss was soft, careful, tentative. Not the passionate kiss of reunion but the gentle kiss of new beginning. Of choosing to try again.

When we pulled apart, Harper was crying.

"Hey," I wiped her tears with my thumbs. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong. I'm just..." She laughed through the tears. "I'm happy. And scared. And I can't believe you're really here. Really staying."

"I'm here. I'm staying. And I love you."

"I love you too."

We stood on the overlook as the sun began its descent, and I felt the last piece of my old life fall away. The drifter who kept moving was gone. In his place was someone willing to stay. Willing to build. Willing to risk everything for the chance at something real.

"Come on," Harper said, tugging my hand. "Let's go back."

"Back to town?"

"Back home."

Home.

Silver Ridge. This town with its mountains and its memories and its second chances.

Home.

I followed Harper down the trail, our hands linked, the future uncertain but chosen.

And for the first time in two years, I wasn't running toward the horizon.

I was walking toward home.
