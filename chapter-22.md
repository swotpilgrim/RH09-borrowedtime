# Chapter 22: The Packing

I started packing that night.

Methodically, like I'd done dozens of times before. Clothes folded into my duffel bag. The few possessions I'd accumulated over the summer set aside to return or leave behind.

Travel light. Don't accumulate things you'll have to leave behind.

I sat on the edge of the bed, duffel bag half-packed, trying to convince myself this was right.

Harper had asked me to decide. Stay or go. Love her or leave her.

I loved her. That had never been the question.

But loving her wasn't enough if I was going to fail at staying. Better to leave cleanly now than try and run later, after she'd built her future around me.

That's what I told myself as I packed.

Outside, the Colorado night was clear. Stars scattered across the sky. Mountains were dark shapes against the horizon.

Frank's footsteps creaked on the porch.

I kept packing.

The next morning, I loaded the duffel bag into my truck. The engine started smooth. I checked everything one more time. The truck was ready. I was ready.

Except I wasn't.

"Heading out?" Frank's voice came from behind me.

I turned. He stood in the driveway, coffee mug in hand, expression unreadable.

"Just getting ready," I said. "Few more days."

Frank nodded slowly. He didn't say anything else. Just stood there watching me, his disappointment so thick I could feel it pressing on my chest.

"Frank—"

"You don't owe me explanations, Jesse." His voice was mild, but his eyes were sad. "You're a grown man. You make your own choices."

"I'm trying to do the right thing."

"For who?"

The question stopped me. "For Harper. For both of us."

Frank took a sip of coffee. "Funny how the 'right thing' looks an awful lot like running scared."

"I'm not running scared. I'm being realistic."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive." Frank turned to go back inside, then paused. "You know what disappoints me most?"

I braced myself. "What?"

"I thought you were braver than this." He didn't say it cruelly. Just stated it as fact, then went inside, leaving me standing in the driveway with his words echoing in my head.

I thought you were braver than this.

I closed the hood of my truck harder than necessary and drove to the construction site, Frank's disappointment following me like a shadow.

The day was long and hot. My hands went through the motions of familiar work while my mind churned uselessly over the same thoughts I'd been having for weeks. Leave now. Stay and fail later. Either way, pain. Either way, loss.

Danny showed up around lunchtime, like he had yesterday. But today there were no sandwiches, no easy conversation. He walked straight up to me where I was measuring boards and his first words were:

"You're a coward."

I looked up, startled by the bluntness. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me." Danny's expression was harder than I'd ever seen it. "You're packing your truck. Getting ready to leave. Running away because you're too scared to risk staying. That makes you a coward."

"You don't understand—"

"I understand plenty." He stepped closer, anger radiating from him. "I understand that you've got a good woman who loves you. I understand that you've got opportunity here, a real chance at a life. And I understand that you're throwing it all away because you're terrified."

"I'm trying to protect her—"

"From what?" Danny's voice rose. "From love? From happiness? From the possibility that maybe, just maybe, things could work out?"

"From the inevitable pain when I leave anyway!"

"So you're leaving now to prevent yourself from leaving later?" Danny shook his head. "Do you hear how stupid that sounds?"

The anger in his voice stung. Danny had been my friend all summer—easy-going, supportive, understanding. I'd never seen him like this.

"It's not stupid. It's realistic."

"No, it's cowardice." Danny's jaw was tight. "You know what you're doing, Jesse? You're doing to yourself exactly what your stepfather did to you. You're rejecting yourself before anyone else can. You're making yourself unwanted because that feels safer than risking someone else making you feel that way."

The comparison hit like a fist to the gut. "That's not—"

"It's exactly what you're doing." Danny cut me off. "Your stepfather made you feel disposable, so now you're disposing of yourself. You're choosing to leave before Harper can reject you, before this town can reject you, before anyone can make you feel how your stepfather made you feel. But you know what? The only person rejecting you right now is you."

I stood there, the truth of his words cutting deep.

"I'm scared," I admitted, voice rough. "I'm terrified of staying and failing. Of hurting her worse than leaving now would."

"And what if you don't fail?" Danny asked. "What if you stay and it works? What if you and Harper build something real, something permanent, something worth all this fear you're carrying?"

"I've got two years of proof I can't stay put—"

"You've got two years of not having a reason to stay put," Danny interrupted. "That's different. Before Silver Ridge, before Harper, what did you have to stay for? Nothing. Just another town, another temporary job, another place you'd eventually leave anyway. But now you've got a reason. You've got her. And you're still choosing fear over love."

"It's not that simple."

"It really is, though." Danny's anger softened slightly, replaced by something like pity. "You're making it complicated because complicated gives you permission to run. But it's simple, Jesse. Do you love her?"

"Yes."

"Do you want to stay?"

"Yes, but—"

"Then stay." Danny spread his hands. "Stop overthinking it. Stop catastrophizing about all the ways it could go wrong. Just stay because you love her and she loves you and that's reason enough to try."

"And when I fail? When the road calls me back and I can't resist it? When I wake up one day and need to leave?"

"Then you deal with it then." Danny's voice was firm. "You communicate with Harper. You work through it together. You don't make decisions now based on fears about the future. You make decisions now based on what you want now. And right now, you want her. Right now, you want to stay. So stay."

He made it sound so easy. So obvious.

"I don't know if I can."

Danny's expression hardened again. "You mean you don't know if you're brave enough."

"Maybe that's the same thing."

"It's not." He picked up his toolbelt, preparing to get back to work. "One's about ability. One's about courage. You're capable of staying, Jesse. You're just not brave enough to try."

He walked away, and I stood there with his words ringing in my ears.

You're capable of staying. You're just not brave enough to try.

The rest of the day passed in a blur. Every nail I hammered felt like punctuation to my cowardice. Every measurement I took felt like calculating the distance I'd put between myself and happiness.

Frank barely spoke to me. The other crew members kept their distance, like they could sense the tension. Danny worked on the opposite side of the site, not looking in my direction.

I'd lost them already, and I hadn't even left yet.

That evening, I returned to Frank's house as the sun set over the mountains. My duffel bag sat on the chair in the spare room, half-packed, a physical reminder of the choice I was making.

I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, and let myself imagine the future I was choosing.

Driving out of Silver Ridge two days from now. Harper watching from her window as my truck disappeared.

A month from now, working another temporary job in another forgettable town. Sleeping in my truck, eating at diners alone.

Christmas in some nowhere town, watching families celebrate while I sat alone.

Next summer, wondering what Harper was doing, if she'd found someone brave enough to stay.

Five years from now, ten years from now, still drifting. Still running. Still alone because I'd been too scared to risk my heart.

The images cut like knives.

But then I imagined the alternative.

Staying. Trying. Six months from now, a year from now, waking up one morning with that familiar itch to leave. The need for the road overwhelming the desire to stay. Packing my truck while Harper watched, betrayal and hurt in her eyes. Leaving after promising to stay. Breaking her heart after she'd trusted me not to.

That image cut deepest of all.

I rolled onto my side, pulling the pillow over my head like I could block out my own thoughts.

Danny's words echoed: *You're doing to yourself exactly what your stepfather did to you.*

Frank's disappointment: *I thought you were braver than this.*

Harper's tears: *I can't fight your fear for you.*

Everyone had tried to tell me. Everyone had pointed out that my fear was driving, that I was choosing this, that I could make a different choice.

But knowing that didn't make the fear go away.

I got up, paced the small room, sat back down. The duffel bag mocked me from the chair. The walls felt too close, the mountains outside the window too confining.

This was why I kept moving. This feeling—trapped, pressured, scared—this was what I'd been running from for two years.

Except now I was realizing that the trap wasn't Silver Ridge or Harper or commitment.

The trap was my own fear.

I could leave Silver Ridge and the fear would follow. I could drive a thousand miles and the fear would be in the passenger seat. I could spend the rest of my life running and never escape it because the thing I was running from was inside me.

The realization should have been freeing.

It just made me feel more trapped.

I lay back down as night deepened outside. Sleep wouldn't come. My mind spun in useless circles, the same arguments playing on repeat.

Stay. Go. Risk it. Run from it. Love her. Leave her.

Brave. Coward.

Two days until the festival. Three days until my original departure date.

Two days to figure out if I was brave enough to risk staying.

Or if I'd proven Danny right—that I was capable but not courageous.

The ceiling offered no answers. The stars outside the window didn't care. The mountains stood eternal and indifferent to one boy's crisis.

And somewhere across town, Harper was probably lying awake too, wondering if the boy she loved would choose fear over her.

I closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but rest wouldn't come.

Just the knowledge that my packed duffel bag sat waiting on the chair, ready for whichever choice I made.

And time was running out to decide.
