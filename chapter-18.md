# Chapter 18: The Festival Announcement

The poster went up on the community center bulletin board mid-August.

**SILVER RIDGE COMMUNITY FESTIVAL**
**Saturday, August 24th, 6 PM**
**Live Music • Dancing • Games • Food**

I stared at it while kids streamed past. The twenty-fourth. Last Saturday of August. Two weeks away. Three days before I was supposed to leave Colorado.

"Jesse!" One of the boys, Tommy, grabbed my arm. "Are you coming to the festival? There's gonna be a dunk tank and everything!"

"We'll see," I said automatically.

"Harper's in charge," Tommy said proudly. "It's gonna be the best festival ever."

Of course Harper was in charge. She'd probably been organizing it all summer while I'd been too wrapped up in my own fear to notice.

Inside the main room, Harper stood on a stepladder hanging decorations. She wore a yellow sundress, hair in a ponytail, laughing at something one of the little girls had said.

She looked happy. Genuinely happy.

Maybe she was better off without me. Maybe the distance had already started healing, letting her invest energy back into things that weren't about to disappear.

"Okay, everyone!" Harper clapped her hands, climbing down. "We've got two weeks to finish our festival projects. Who remembers what we're making?"

Hands shot up. Kids called out projects—signs, bracelets, lanterns. Harper directed them to workstations with patient efficiency.

I drifted to the edge of the room, uncertain. Usually Harper would have given me a task by now. But today she didn't look my way, focused entirely on the kids.

"Mr. Jesse!" A small voice piped up. I looked down to find Sarah, one of the youngest girls, tugging on my sleeve. "Can you help me with my lantern?"

"Sure, sweetheart." I crouched beside her table, grateful for something to do with my hands.

Sarah chattered while we worked, telling me all about the festival. "Mama says there's gonna be dancing. Like, real dancing with a band and everything. Not just records." Her eyes were wide with excitement. "Have you ever been to a dance, Mr. Jesse?"

"A few," I admitted, helping her smooth out a wrinkle in the paper.

"Are you taking Miss Harper?"

The question caught me off guard. "What?"

"To the festival. To the dance part." Sarah looked at me like this was obvious. "You're supposed to take her. Everyone knows you like her."

Everyone knows. The words sat heavy in my chest. In a town this small, of course everyone knew. Everyone had watched us all summer—getting milkshakes, hiking together, spending hours at this very community center. They'd watched us get close, and now they were watching us fall apart.

"I don't know if I'll be there," I said carefully.

"But you have to be there!" Sarah's face fell. "It's the best night of the whole summer. You can't miss it."

"We'll see." I finished helping her with the lantern and stood, needing to put some distance between me and the kid's innocent questions.

I moved to the supply closet, organizing paint bottles that didn't need organizing. Through the open door, I could hear Harper talking with another group, her voice warm and encouraging. She'd probably already been asked about the festival a dozen times today. She was right in the middle of it all, essential and loved by this community in a way I'd never be.

"Jesse?"

I turned to find Harper in the closet doorway. Up close, I could see the careful neutrality in her expression, the wall she'd built to match mine.

"Yeah?"

"Can you help move the tables after the session? We need to rearrange for next week's festival prep."

"Sure."

She nodded and turned to leave, but I found myself speaking before I could stop myself. "The festival looks like it'll be good."

Harper paused, glancing back. "It should be. The kids have worked hard."

"You've worked hard."

Something flickered in her eyes—surprise, maybe, that I'd noticed. "It's part of my job."

"It's more than that." I set down the paint bottle I'd been holding. "You care about these kids. About making sure they have something special."

"Of course I do." Her voice was quiet. "They deserve it."

We stood there in the narrow closet, the noise of the kids beyond us, and I wanted to say more. Wanted to tell her she deserved something special too, that she deserved better than a boy too scared to stay. But the words stuck in my throat.

"I should get back," Harper said finally. "They're getting loud."

She left, and I remained in the closet like a coward, hiding among paint bottles and construction paper.

The session ended an hour later in a controlled chaos of kids being collected by parents, everyone talking excitedly about the upcoming festival. I helped Harper and the other volunteers clean up, moving tables and stacking chairs.

"Jesse's coming to the festival, right?" Tommy asked Harper as his mother gathered his things. "He's gotta be there."

"I'm not sure what Jesse's plans are," Harper said evenly, not looking at me.

"But—"

"Tommy, time to go," his mother interrupted, clearly sensing the tension.

After the last family left, just Harper and I remained to finish the cleanup. We worked in silence, the easy companionship we used to share replaced by careful distance.

Then from the doorway, eight-year-old Megan called out. She'd come back in, probably forgotten something. "Miss Harper! Is Mr. Jesse taking you to the dance?"

Harper's hands stilled on the broom she was holding.

"He's probably leaving before then," she said, her voice carefully light. "So I wouldn't worry about it."

Megan frowned, confused. "But the festival's only two weeks away. Where are you going, Mr. Jesse?"

I didn't have an answer. Everywhere and nowhere. Anywhere but here. Another town, another temporary job, another place where I wouldn't have to risk my heart.

"I've got plans to travel," I said finally.

"But you'll come back, right? For the festival?"

"Megan!" Her father appeared in the doorway. "Stop bothering them and get in the car."

The little girl left with a wave, oblivious to the hurt she'd poked at.

Harper went back to sweeping, her movements jerky. I saw the moment the hurt crossed her face—quick, like a flash of lightning, before she controlled her expression.

"Harper—"

"Don't." She didn't look up. "You don't owe me an explanation. You've been clear about leaving. I knew that from day one."

"It's not that simple."

"Isn't it?" Now she did look at me, and the pain in her eyes was devastating. "You're leaving. I'm staying. That's pretty simple."

"I never meant to hurt you."

"I know." Her voice cracked slightly. "That almost makes it worse."

She finished sweeping quickly, put the broom away, and grabbed her bag. "Lock up when you leave?"

"Harper, wait—"

But she was already walking out, and I let her go because I didn't know what else to say. Every word felt like another cut, another promise I couldn't make.

I locked up the community center and drove back to Frank's house as the sun set over the mountains. My truck sat in the driveway, faithful and ready. I ran my hand along the hood, still warm from the day's heat.

Two weeks until the festival. Two weeks and a few days until September.

I could leave before the festival. Pack up tonight, tell Frank I appreciated the work but it was time to move on, be out of Silver Ridge by morning. Clean break. No prolonged goodbye, no last dance, no watching Harper smile at everyone but me.

Or I could stay through the festival. Go with Harper, give her that last night, dance with her under string lights and pretend for a few hours that September wasn't coming. Then leave, carrying the memory of one perfect evening and the weight of her heartbreak.

Or I could...

I shut that thought down before it fully formed. The third option—staying, actually staying past September—was impossible. I'd been over this a hundred times in my head. I didn't know how to stay. Two years of drifting had proved that. Even if I wanted to stay for Harper, wanting wasn't enough. I'd eventually wake up needing the road again, and then I'd leave anyway, breaking her heart worse than leaving now ever could.

Wouldn't I?

I sat on the porch steps as darkness fell, trying to make sense of my tangled thoughts. Two weeks felt like forever and no time at all. The festival loomed like a deadline, a final accounting of my summer in Silver Ridge.

The screen door creaked and Frank stepped out, two bottles of Coca-Cola in hand. He passed me one without comment and sat on the step beside me.

"Festival's coming up," he said after a long silence.

"Yeah."

"You planning to be there?"

I took a drink of the Coke, cold and sweet. "I don't know."

"Seems like a simple question."

"Nothing about this is simple."

Frank was quiet, watching the stars emerge over the mountains. "You know what I think?"

"What?"

"I think you're making it complicated because complicated gives you an excuse not to choose."

The observation hit too close to home. "That's not fair."

"Maybe not." Frank stood, brushing dust off his pants. "But it's true. You can't stay in the middle forever, son. Eventually you have to pick a direction—toward her or away from her. Sitting here paralyzed is just another way of choosing to leave."

He went inside, leaving me alone with my Coke and my cowardice.

I thought about Megan's confused face. *But the festival's only two weeks away. Where are you going?*

I thought about Harper's controlled pain. *You're leaving. I'm staying. That's pretty simple.*

I thought about Tommy's excitement. *It's gonna be the best festival ever!*

Two weeks. Fourteen days. Three hundred and thirty-six hours.

And then I'd have to choose whether to stay for something I didn't know how to keep, or leave something I wasn't sure I could live without.

The Coke bottle sweated in my hand, and the Colorado night settled around me, beautiful and still. Inside Frank's house, a radio played softly. Down the street, a dog barked. The world kept turning, indifferent to my crisis.

The festival poster had said: Celebrate Summer's End.

End. That's what this was building toward. The end of summer, the end of borrowed time, the end of this fragile thing Harper and I had built together.

Unless I was brave enough to choose a different ending.

But bravery had never been my strong suit. Running, that's what I knew. And I had two weeks to decide if this time would be different.

I finished the Coke and went inside to a sleepless night, the calendar on Frank's wall mocking me with its march toward August twenty-fourth.
