# Chapter 1: Rolling Into Town

The mountains come into view first, rising up on all sides like walls holding Silver Ridge in place. I downshift the Chevy as the highway turns into main street, two lanes of cracked asphalt lined with brick storefronts that've probably looked the same since before the war. Hardware store with rakes and shovels displayed out front. Diner with chrome trim catching the June sunlight, its windows full of people eating Saturday lunch. Five and dime with a Coca-Cola sign hanging above the door. A Texaco station where an old man in coveralls watches my truck rattle past, his eyes tracking me with that particular look small towns give to strangers—curious, assessing, already deciding whether I'm worth knowing.

I'm used to that look. Been getting it for two years now, ever since I left home and started drifting. Tucson, Bend, Billings, Sacramento—I've seen that same expression in a dozen different towns, worn by a dozen different faces. The look that says: you're not from here.

The truck's engine knocks a little as I slow down, reminding me I need to check the timing before I leave in September. Three months. That's what I told Uncle Frank on the phone—I'd come work construction for the summer, earn some money, then move on. Same arrangement I've had in a dozen towns across the west. Temporary work, temporary housing, temporary everything.

That's how I like it.

Frank's house is on the east side of town, past the neat yards and white picket fences, where the streets get narrower and the houses sit closer together. Working-class neighborhood, the kind where men carry lunch pails and everyone knows everyone's business. I pull up to a small craftsman painted faded yellow, its porch sagging slightly on one side. The lawn's mowed neat though, and someone's planted flowers along the walk.

I kill the engine and sit for a minute in the sudden quiet. Through the windshield, I can see the mountains again, ringing the whole town like it's something precious that needs protecting. Or maybe like it's something that needs containing.

The front door opens before I'm halfway up the walk.

"Jesse."

Uncle Frank stands on the porch, a big man going gray at the temples, wearing work pants and a clean white undershirt. He's my father's older brother, though I haven't seen him since I was maybe ten years old. He looks older now, more weathered, but his handshake is still firm when I reach him.

"Uncle Frank. Thanks for having me."

"Frank's fine." He eyes my truck briefly, taking in the dented fender and the way it sits low on the left side. "Made it here in one piece, I see."

"She runs better than she looks."

"She'd have to." There might be humor in his voice, but his face doesn't show it. He steps back, holding the door open. "Come on in. I'll show you where you'll be staying."

The house is spare inside, clean but without much decoration. A couch and armchair face a television in the front room. Small kitchen visible beyond. Everything neat, everything in its place. The house of a man who lives alone and likes it that way.

Frank leads me down a short hallway to a door at the end. "Spare room's yours for the summer. Bathroom's across the hall."

The room is small—single bed with a blue blanket, dresser with three drawers, window looking out at the mountains. Clean but impersonal, like a motel room. Perfect for someone just passing through.

"It's good. Thank you."

I head back to the truck for my duffel bag. Everything I own fits in one bag. Two pairs of jeans, few shirts, work boots, shaving kit, transistor radio. That's it. Learned early that traveling light makes leaving easier, and I'm always leaving eventually.

When I come back inside, Frank's in the kitchen pouring coffee into two mugs.

"Sit," he says, and I take a chair at the small table.

He sets a mug in front of me and settles into the opposite chair. For a minute we just drink in silence, and I'm grateful he's not the type to fill air with unnecessary words. I've met too many people who talk at you instead of to you, asking questions they don't really want answers to.

"Construction work starts Monday," Frank says finally. "Six in the morning, we work till three when the heat breaks. Good crew, hard workers. You know your way around a job site?"

"I've worked construction before. Framing, mostly. Some roofing."

He nods, satisfied. "Pay's fair. Room and board here's free, but there's conditions."

Here it comes. There's always conditions with free housing. I keep my face neutral, waiting.

"You go to church on Sundays. Community center's got a chapel, service is at ten. And you volunteer at the youth programs there, couple afternoons a week. Reverend Wells runs it—he's a good man. They need help with the summer kids."

I take another swallow of coffee, considering. Church I can handle—I've sat through enough services in different towns. Volunteering with kids isn't my first choice, but it's not the worst condition I've heard. Some places wanted me to stay sober, which I would've done anyway. Some wanted references I didn't have.

"That's fine," I say. "I can do that."

"Good." Frank stands, rinses his mug in the sink. "You settle in today and tomorrow. I'll take you to service Sunday morning, introduce you to folks. Monday you start work."

"Sounds good."

He pauses at the kitchen doorway, looking back at me with those steady eyes that don't miss much. "You planning to stay past summer?"

The question catches me off guard, though it shouldn't. It's a reasonable thing to ask.

"No, sir. Just the summer, like I said on the phone. I appreciate the work and the place to stay, but come September I'll be moving on."

Something flickers across Frank's face—maybe disappointment, maybe just acknowledgment. Hard to tell with him.

"All right then. Good to know where things stand."

He disappears down the hall, and I hear his bedroom door close softly.

I sit at the kitchen table a while longer, finishing my coffee. Through the window over the sink I can see a slice of mountains, blue-gray in the afternoon light. Pretty country, I'll give it that. Colorado's different from the desert towns I worked in Arizona, different from the coastal villages in Oregon, different from the ranch land in Montana.

But pretty doesn't mean permanent.

I rinse my mug and head to the spare room. The duffel bag looks small sitting on the blue blanket, like it knows it doesn't belong. I unpack anyway, hanging my shirts in the narrow closet, putting my other pair of jeans in the dresser drawer. It takes maybe five minutes.

The room still looks empty when I'm done.

I sit on the edge of the bed, testing the mattress. Firm but not uncomfortable. The window's open a crack and I can hear sounds from the neighborhood—someone's radio playing what sounds like Perry Como, kids laughing somewhere down the street, a dog barking at something only it can see. Normal sounds. Family sounds. Saturday afternoon in a town where people stay and build lives and know their neighbors' names. The kind of sounds I stopped expecting to be part of two years ago when my mother remarried and her new husband made it clear there wasn't room for me in their new life.

Jim. That was his name. Jim Crawford, who owned a shoe store and wore ties every day and wanted a fresh start with my mother that didn't include her nearly-grown son from her first marriage. He never said it directly—he was too smart for that. Just made it clear in a hundred small ways that I was in the way, that I was a reminder of something he'd rather forget, that my presence made his new life with my mother less perfect.

I left before he could throw me out. Seemed better that way, leaving on my own terms. At least that way I could tell myself it was my choice.

Since then it's been like this—temporary rooms in temporary towns, working jobs that last a season or a summer, never staying long enough to put down roots or give anyone reason to expect me to. Safer that way. Cleaner. Nobody gets hurt when you're honest about leaving from the start.

Silver Ridge is just another stop. Three months to work construction, save some money, fix whatever's wrong with the truck's transmission. Then I'll head south before winter, maybe California, maybe Arizona again. Somewhere warm where there's work.

The mountains outside the window don't care about my plans. They just sit there, solid and permanent, the kind of thing that stays while everything else moves on.

I've got that backwards, I think. I'm the one moving on. The mountains and the town and Uncle Frank—they're the ones staying.

I lie back on the bed, hands behind my head, staring at the unfamiliar ceiling. There's a water stain in one corner, shaped vaguely like a bird with its wings spread. Or maybe it's a cloud. Depends on how you look at it. The calendar in my head is already counting: ninety days, give or take. Twelve weeks. One summer. Eighty-nine days if you count today, but today barely counts since I just got here.

Borrowed time.

That's all this is. Borrowed time in a borrowed room in a town I'll barely remember this time next year. By next June I'll probably have trouble placing which state Silver Ridge is even in, let alone remembering what Frank's spare room looked like or what the mountains sounded like when the wind came through.

I close my eyes and try to picture where I might be next June. Mexico, maybe. Or up in Montana if there's ranch work. Could go back to Oregon, see if that lumber mill's still hiring. The possibilities stretch out like the highway, going everywhere and nowhere at once.

It's comfortable, that uncertainty. Easier than staying still. Easier than risking that someone might make it clear I don't belong.

Better to keep moving.

My eyes open again and I stare at the ceiling, at the cracks in the plaster forming patterns like roads on a map. The afternoon sunlight slants through the window, warm on my face.

Three months. I can do three months anywhere.

Then I'm gone.
