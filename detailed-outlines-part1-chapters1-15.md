- One afternoon Harper asks where he's from originally. Jesse gives vague answers about moving around after leaving home.

- Harper admits she's never left Colorado, barely left this town except for school trips to Denver. Her family expects her to stay, probably marry local, settle down. When she talks about the mountains surrounding Silver Ridge, Jesse hears both love and restlessness.
- Jesse recognizes that feeling—being trapped even in a beautiful place. For the first time, he wants to show someone the world beyond their horizon. Then he remembers he's leaving in September, and offering her those experiences would be cruel.

- Jesse tells her there's nothing wrong with wanting to see the world. Her parents just want her safe, which he understands, but safety and settling aren't the same thing. Harper says sometimes safe feels like small, and she's scared she'll wake up at forty never having left these mountains.
- Jesse finds himself wanting to take her everywhere, show her the ocean and deserts and big cities, watch her experience them for the first time. Then he remembers he's leaving in September, and offering her those things would be cruel when he can't deliver.

Harper tells him about growing up in a fishbowl where everyone watches and knows your business. Jesse tells her about the freedom of the road but also the loneliness of never belonging anywhere.

- Danny notices Jesse and Harper spending time together, makes teasing comments. Jesse deflects but he's aware the town's starting to notice too. He sees Reverend Wells watching them with concern.

- Harper asks directly what Jesse's running from. He's startled by her directness and perception. She says she's not judging, just recognizing something familiar—his need to leave looks like her need to go, just acted on instead of suppressed.
- Jesse admits his stepfather made it clear he wasn't wanted, so he left before being thrown out. Harper's quiet, then says maybe he's not running from something but toward something, he just hasn't found it yet. The conversation shifts something fundamental between them.

- At the community center, watching Harper work with a troubled kid, Jesse has the clear thought: I don't want to be anywhere else. Not just in this moment, but in general. For the first time since leaving home, he wants to stay in one place.
- Jesse tries to logic himself out of it—he's got eight weeks before September, no permanent job, no reason to stay beyond her, no idea how to be someone who stays anyway. But the feelings don't respond to logic.
- That night in Frank's spare room, Jesse lies awake staring at the ceiling, forcing himself to face the truth: he's in love with Harper Wells. He's fallen for a girl he's supposed to leave, in a town that's supposed to be temporary. Wanting to stay and knowing how to stay are two different things, and Jesse's only ever known how to go. The realization fills him with equal parts longing and terror.

- That evening at the community center, Harper mentions her father asking questions too. She tries to keep it light, but Jesse sees worry underneath.

**Setting:** Frank's spare room, late night  
**Time:** Night, mid-July

**Purpose:** Jesse analyzes the practical and emotional obstacles to staying, revealing the depth of his fear and internal conflict.

**Beats:**
- Jesse lies awake analyzing what staying would require. He'd need permanent work—construction exists in Silver Ridge but Frank's crew is seasonal and small. He'd need a place to live beyond Frank's spare room. He'd need to commit to a town where he's still the outsider, where Harper's family has concerns.
- Most terrifying: he'd need to trust himself not to eventually revert to drifting. What if he stays six months, a year, and then wakes up needing the road? He'd hurt Harper infinitely worse than leaving now would.
- Jesse wants to stay, wants Harper, wants this glimpse of stable life he's had with her. But wanting and knowing how are different. He's spent two years proving he's someone who leaves. One summer with Harper doesn't erase that pattern or change his fundamental nature.
- Jesse cycles through these thoughts for hours, unable to sleep. He's caught between desire and fear, unable to move in either direction. The only certainty is that time's running out—six weeks until his planned departure—and paralysis is its own kind of choice.

**POV:** Jesse Carter, first person

**Time:** Late afternoon, third week of July

**Purpose:** Harper confronts Jesse about his internal struggle, forcing honesty about feelings neither can fully act on.

**Beats:**
- Harper's not blind to Jesse's struggle. She sees him pull back when conversations turn to fall plans, notices his subject changes when September gets mentioned. After a community center session, she asks if they can talk privately.
- Outside, Harper tells Jesse she knows he's planning to leave when summer ends—he's never hidden that. She's tried to protect her heart by keeping perspective, but she needs honesty from him. Is he interested in her or just passing time while he's here?
- Jesse's torn between protecting them both by pulling away and being truthful about feelings he can't back up with commitment. He tells her he cares about her, more than he should given he's leaving. The words come out rough, honest.
- Harper asks why he has to leave if he doesn't want to. Jesse struggles to articulate his fear—that even if he tries to stay, he'll fail at it eventually. Harper deserves someone who knows how to stay, not someone who'll eventually run. Harper's quiet, then says maybe she should be allowed to decide what she deserves. She doesn't push further, but the conversation hangs unresolved between them.

**Dialogue Topics:** Harper's direct questions about Jesse's intentions, his honest admission of caring for her while still planning to leave, her question about why leaving has to be inevitable, his struggle to explain his fear of failing at staying, her assertion that she can make her own choices about risk.

**POV:** Jesse Carter, first person  
**Setting:** Construction site, lunch break  
**Time:** Midday, late July

**Purpose:** Danny provides external perspective on Jesse's fear, challenging his certainty that leaving is inevitable.

**Beats:**
- Jesse finally opens up to Danny during lunch break. They sit in shade of Jesse's truck, and Jesse admits his fear that staying will end badly, that he'll hurt Harper eventually by reverting to his drifter nature.
- Danny listens, then asks bluntly: what if Jesse's wrong? What if the reason he's always left before is because he never had a reason to stay, and Harper's giving him that reason? Jesse argues wanting and being able are different things.
- Danny talks about his own experience with Carol Ann, how committing to her scared him initially. He was afraid of being tied down, losing freedom. Then he realized losing Carol Ann would hurt infinitely more than risking his heart with her. Love's worth trying for.
- After work, Frank mentions quietly that running's easier than staying, but easier doesn't mean better. Jesse realizes even his taciturn uncle is weighing in. Everyone sees what Jesse's fighting—the question is whether Jesse's brave enough to fight his fear instead of fighting his feelings.

**Dialogue Topics:** Jesse's admission of fear about hurting Harper, Danny's story about committing to Carol Ann, discussion of whether people can change their patterns or if patterns are destiny, Frank's brief but pointed comment about running versus staying, Jesse's arguments against his own happiness.

**Purpose:** Harper and Jesse have their most honest conversation about the future, Jesse's inability to commit hurts Harper despite her understanding.

**Beats:**
- Late July evening, Jesse and Harper drive to the overlook to watch sunset. Conversation turns to fall—Harper will be a senior, has college applications to consider though her parents want her close. Jesse deflects questions about his September plans.
- Harper finally asks directly: is there any version of September where he stays? Jesse wants to say yes, wants to promise her everything, but fear chokes the words. He tells her he doesn't know how to stay, that he's terrified of trying and failing.
- Harper's eyes fill with hurt she tries to hide. She says she understands, that she knew from the start he was temporary. But Jesse hears the unasked question underneath: Am I not worth trying for? The question cuts him because he can't answer it honestly—she is worth trying for, but he's terrified he'll fail her.
- The drive back to town is quiet. Harper thanks him for his honesty, says she needs to think about whether she can handle loving someone on borrowed time. Jesse watches her walk into her house and knows he's hurting her by not being brave enough to risk staying. But the fear of hurting her worse later paralyzes him from choosing her now.
