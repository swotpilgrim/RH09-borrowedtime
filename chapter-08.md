# Chapter 8: Spending Time Together

Late June turns into something I didn't plan for.

It starts with Harper suggesting we hike on Saturday. "There's this trail I want to show you," she says after Friday's community center session. "Goes up to a viewpoint overlooking the valley. If you're not busy."

I should say I'm busy. Should keep our interactions to the community center, maintain boundaries. But I hear myself say, "What time?"

So Saturday morning I meet her at the trailhead on the edge of town, and we hike up through pine forests that smell like sap and earth. Harper knows these trails like she knows the streets of Silver Ridge—every switchback, every viewpoint, the spots where wildflowers grow in summer.

"Been hiking these mountains since I was six," she says, leading the way up a steep section. She's wearing dungarees rolled at the ankles and a plaid shirt, her hair in a braid down her back. "My dad used to bring me up here when I needed to think. Said sometimes you have to get above things to see them clearly."

"Does it work?"

"Sometimes. Sometimes you just get a nice view and tired legs."

The trail opens onto a rocky outcrop with a view that stretches for miles—Silver Ridge below, the valley spreading beyond, mountains in every direction. Harper sits on a flat boulder and I settle beside her, both of us catching our breath.

"This is my favorite spot," she says. "When Silver Ridge feels too small, I come up here and remind myself there's more world out there."

"But you can see Silver Ridge from here. You're still looking at it."

"That's the point. I can see it from a distance, see how small it actually is." She picks up a pebble, turning it in her fingers. "Makes it easier to imagine leaving."

We sit in comfortable silence, the kind that doesn't need filling. Wind rustles through the pines below. A hawk circles somewhere overhead.

"Tell me about Montana," Harper says eventually. "You said you worked a ranch there?"

So I tell her about the ranch outside Billings, the vastness of the landscape, the hard physical work of mending fences and moving cattle. How the rancher's wife fed the hands three meals a day at a long table in the ranch house kitchen. How at night you could hear coyotes singing to each other across the plains.

Harper listens with that focused attention she has, like she's storing every detail to imagine later.

"Did you like it there?"

"Parts of it. The work was good. The people were fair." I remember the rancher telling me I could stay on if I wanted, that he could use a reliable hand year-round. "But I left after two months."

"Why?"

"Because I'd planned to leave after two months. That was the arrangement."

Harper looks at me sideways. "What if you hadn't planned to leave? What if you'd just let yourself stay until you wanted to go?"

"I don't know how to do that."

"Maybe you should learn."

The words hang between us. She's not pushing, just stating what she sees. It's one of the things I'm starting to notice about Harper—she says what she thinks without making it a judgment.

After the hike we get milkshakes at the diner on main street. It's the lunch rush, booths full of families and couples. We slide into a booth near the window and a waitress who calls Harper "honey" brings us chocolate malts without us even ordering.

"You're a regular," I observe.

"Everyone's a regular at Millie's. It's the only diner in town." Harper pulls the paper off her straw. "But yes, I've been coming here since I was little. Saturday milkshakes with my dad used to be our tradition."

"Used to be?"

"He's busier now. More church responsibilities." There's no resentment in her voice, just acceptance. "Growing up means your parents have less time for milkshakes."

Danny walks in with a pretty blonde girl who must be Carol Ann. He spots us and grins, steering her toward our booth.

"Jesse! And Harper. This is unexpected." Danny's grin suggests it's not unexpected at all. "Carol Ann, this is Jesse, the guy I've been telling you about. Jesse, my girl Carol Ann."

Carol Ann slides into the booth beside Harper, studying me with frank curiosity. "So you're real. Danny said you were, but I was starting to wonder."

"Real and right here," Danny says, squeezing in beside me. "What are you two up to?"

"Hiking," Harper says. "Showed Jesse the overlook trail."

"The overlook? That's a serious hike." Carol Ann looks between us with interest. "Harper only takes people up there if she likes them."

Harper kicks her under the table. "I take lots of people up there."

"Name one person besides me and your dad."

Harper can't, which makes Carol Ann smile knowingly. I feel suddenly visible in a way I don't like—like Carol Ann's seeing more than I want her to see.

"How's the construction going?" Danny asks, rescuing us from the moment. "Frank said you guys are ahead of schedule."

We talk about work while the girls talk about something else in lower voices. The diner's crowded and noisy, the jukebox playing Buddy Holly, and it feels strangely normal—sitting in a booth with people my age, drinking milkshakes, being part of the Saturday afternoon scene.

When we leave, Carol Ann pulls Harper aside while Danny walks out with me.

"So," Danny says casually. "You and Harper hiking together."

"She suggested it."

"Harper doesn't suggest hikes to just anyone, man. That's like, a big deal for her." He claps my shoulder. "Just saying. She likes you."

"We're friends."

"Sure. Friends." Danny's tone suggests he knows better. "Just remember she's the minister's daughter and the whole town watches out for her."

"I know."

"And you're leaving in September."

"I know that too."

"Do you?" Danny looks at me seriously. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're starting to forget."

His words stay with me the rest of the day. That evening, lying in Frank's spare room with the window open, I think about what Danny said. Am I forgetting I'm leaving? Or am I just letting myself enjoy the summer while I'm here?

The next week falls into a new pattern. Community center Monday, Wednesday, Friday. But also: Harper and me getting coffee after sessions. Walking main street when the shops close, talking about everything and nothing. Her showing me places in Silver Ridge that matter to her—the park where she learned to ride a bike, the library where she spent childhood summers reading travel books, the bench behind the church where she sits when she needs quiet.

I'm learning Silver Ridge through Harper's eyes, and it's different from seeing it as just another temporary stop. The town has stories now, history, meaning beyond being the place I'm working this summer.

Wednesday afternoon at the community center, after the kids have gone, Harper asks what I'm reading.

"Western." I show her the paperback from my back pocket. "Got it at the five and dime."

"Any good?"

"It's all right. Cowboys and cattle rustlers, same plot as all of them."

"You like westerns?"

"They're easy. Good guys, bad guys, everyone knows their place." I lean against the table where she's organizing craft supplies. "What do you read?"

"Everything. But especially books about places far away. Travel memoirs, adventure stories, anything that takes me out of Silver Ridge for a while." She finishes sorting the colored pencils. "I told you about East of Eden, right? Steinbeck?"

"You mentioned it."

"I have a copy at home. I could lend it to you, if you want."

"Sure. I'll read it."

Harper looks pleased, like this small thing matters. "I'll bring it Friday. You'll love it, I think. It's about families and choices and California. Lots of traveling, people looking for something better."

"Sounds familiar."

"That's what I thought."

Friday she brings the book—a worn hardcover that clearly means something to her. I can tell by how carefully she holds it.

"This was my mom's copy," Harper says, handing it over. "She gave it to me when I turned sixteen. So be careful with it."

"I'll treat it like it's precious."

"It kind of is." She smiles. "But I trust you with it."

That night I start reading. The prose is different from the westerns I usually read—richer, deeper, asking questions instead of just telling stories. I can see why Harper loves it. And I can see why she wanted me to read it—the characters searching for home, for belonging, for redemption from their pasts.

It's uncomfortably close to my own story.

By the time I finish the first fifty pages, I understand that Harper's not just lending me a book. She's sharing something important, showing me how she sees the world.

And I'm starting to see why that's dangerous.

Because every coffee, every walk, every shared book makes leaving harder. Every conversation where Harper asks real questions and listens to real answers makes Silver Ridge less temporary and more like somewhere I could imagine staying.

Danny was right. I am forgetting I'm leaving.

Or maybe I'm just starting to realize that leaving isn't inevitable. That it's a choice I'm making, and I could make a different choice if I was brave enough.

That thought should terrify me.

Instead, it just makes me want to spend more time with Harper.
