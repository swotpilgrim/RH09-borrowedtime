# Chapter 25: Danny's Final Push

Harper and I were still sitting on the back steps of the community center, hands joined,  when Danny found us.

"There you are." He appeared around the corner, then stopped when he saw us together. "Oh. Am I interrupting?"

"No," Harper said, though she didn't let go of my hand. "What's up?"

"Just looking for Jesse. Thought he might've bolted." Danny's eyes flicked between us, reading the situation. "But clearly not."

"I'm staying," I said. The words came easier this time.

Danny's eyebrows rose. "Staying staying? Or staying-for-now staying?"

"Staying." I squeezed Harper's hand. "Taking Frank's job offer. Finding a place to rent. Actually staying."

A grin spread across Danny's face. "About damn time."

Harper stood, pulling her hand from mine. "I should get back to the booth. Carol Ann's been covering for me."

"Harper—" I started to stand.

"I meant what I said." She looked down at me, expression still guarded. "I need time to process this. To believe it's real. But... I'm glad you're staying." A small smile. "I'll see you around, Jesse."

She walked back toward the festival, leaving me and Danny alone in the quiet.

Danny sat down where Harper had been. "So. You finally figured it out."

"Yeah."

"What changed?"

I leaned back against the steps, looking up at the darkening sky. "I saw her with those kids. And I realized I didn't want to belong anywhere else. That all my reasons for leaving were just fear dressed up as logic."

"I could've told you that weeks ago."

"You did tell me that weeks ago."

"Yeah, but you didn't listen." Danny pulled out a pack of cigarettes, offered me one. I shook my head. He lit his, took a drag. "What made you listen tonight?"

"I don't know. Maybe I just hit the breaking point. Maybe watching her belong somewhere made me want to belong too. Maybe I finally got tired of being scared."

Danny was quiet for a moment, smoke curling up into the evening air. "You know what I think?"

"What?"

"I think you've been looking for permission to stay. Waiting for someone to tell you it's okay, that you're allowed to want this." He flicked ash off the cigarette. "But no one can give you that except yourself."

"That's pretty deep for you."

"I have my moments." He grinned. "Seriously though. I'm glad you're staying. You're good for Harper. And you're a good friend. Would've sucked to lose you."

The casual declaration of friendship hit harder than expected. "I would've sucked to lose you too."

"So don't." Danny took another drag. "Don't make this one good choice and then fuck it up six months from now when things get hard. Staying isn't a one-time decision. It's choosing to stay every day, even when it's tough."

"I know."

"Do you?" He looked at me directly. "Because there's gonna be days you want to run. Days when the mountains feel too close and the town feels too small and your truck is right there, ready to take you anywhere. What are you gonna do then?"

The question was fair. "Talk to Harper. Talk to Frank. Hell, talk to you. Not run away and hide like I've been doing."

"Good answer." Danny stubbed out his cigarette. "And when you're scared? When the fear gets loud again?"

"Same thing. Talk about it instead of running from it."

"And when Harper's scared? When she's worried you're gonna leave?"

"Reassure her. Show up. Keep choosing her."

Danny nodded slowly. "Okay. I believe you mean it. Question is whether you'll actually do it when it counts."

"I will."

"I'm gonna hold you to that." He stood, offered me a hand up. "Come on. Let's get back to the festival. You've got people to prove yourself to."

I took his hand, let him pull me up. "Starting tonight?"

"Starting right now." He clapped my shoulder. "Welcome to Silver Ridge, Jesse. For real this time."

We walked back toward the festival lights and music, and I felt something settle in my chest. Not the absence of fear—that was still there, probably always would be. But the decision to act despite it.

I was staying.

And I had friends who'd hold me accountable to that choice.

The festival was still in full swing when we emerged from behind the building. Danny immediately spotted Carol Ann and headed her direction. I stood on the edge of the crowd, watching the town celebrate.

Frank caught my eye from across the street and nodded once. I nodded back, understanding passing between us. He'd known I'd figure it out eventually. Had been patient while I worked through my fear.

The youth center booth was busy, kids and parents clustered around looking at the summer projects. Harper stood in the middle of it, helping a mother purchase one of the friendship bracelets. She looked up, saw me watching, and our eyes met.

She didn't smile. Didn't wave me over. Just looked at me for a long moment, then turned back to her customer.

Fair enough. I'd asked her to trust me after weeks of hurting her. That trust had to be earned, not given.

I made my way through the crowd to the booth, not to interrupt Harper but to help. One of the boys was trying to show his parents the painted sign he'd made, but it had slipped behind the display. I reached over, retrieved it, handed it to him.

"Thanks, Mr. Jesse!" Tommy grinned up at me.

"Nice work on this," I told him, examining the sign. "You did a good job with the lettering."

Tommy beamed, showing his parents with renewed enthusiasm.

I moved around the booth, helping kids show their work, answering questions from parents, making myself useful. Harper watched from the corner of her eye but didn't comment.

After about twenty minutes, the crowd thinned. Carol Ann appeared at Harper's elbow.

"I'm gonna grab some food. You want anything?"

Harper shook her head. Carol Ann looked at me, then back at Harper, some silent communication passing between them. Then Carol Ann grinned and walked away.

Harper started straightening the displays, and I helped without asking. We worked in silence for a few minutes, the festival noise around us but our own space quiet.

"You don't have to do this," Harper said finally.

"I want to."

"Jesse—"

"I know you need time. I know I have to prove this is real." I straightened a row of painted rocks. "But I'm here. I'm helping. I'm showing up. That's what staying looks like, right?"

She stopped, looked at me. "It's a start."

"Then it's a start I'm committed to making."

The ghost of a smile crossed her face. "You're really staying."

"I'm really staying."

"And tomorrow morning? When you wake up and your truck is packed and the road is right there?"

"Tomorrow morning I'm going to unpack my truck. I'm going to talk to Frank about the Jensen Construction job. I'm going to start looking for a place to rent." I met her eyes. "And I'm going to hope that maybe, eventually, you'll believe I mean it."

Harper's smile grew slightly. "It's going to take more than one night, you know."

"I know. Good thing I'm planning to stick around."

She shook her head, but the smile remained. "You're infuriating."

"Yeah. But I'm infuriating and staying."

"We'll see."

But the walls in her expression had cracked a little more. Not gone—I'd hurt her too much for them to disappear that fast. But cracked enough that I could see the hope underneath.

It was enough. For tonight, it was enough.

The festival went on around us, and I stayed at the booth. Helping with the kids, talking to parents, making myself part of the community instead of an outsider observing it.

And when the festival finally wound down, when families gathered their tired children and headed home, I helped Harper and Carol Ann pack up the booth. Loading boxes, taking down decorations, cleaning up the space.

Small things. Ordinary things.

The things you do when you're staying.

Danny stopped by as we were finishing. "You need a ride, Jesse? Or are you walking Harper home?"

I looked at Harper. She looked back, considering.

"He can walk me home," she said finally. "If he wants."

"I want."

Danny grinned. "See you tomorrow then. At work. Because you'll be there. Because you're staying."

"I'll be there."

He walked away whistling, and Carol Ann hugged Harper goodnight before heading to her own car.

Then it was just Harper and me in the town square, festival lights being turned off one by one, the summer night settling around us.

"Ready?" I asked.

She nodded, and we started walking toward her house.

Neither of us reached for the other's hand. Too soon for that. But we walked close enough that our arms occasionally brushed, and that was something.

"Thank you," Harper said as we walked. "For coming tonight. For being honest about what changed."

"Thank you for listening. For not telling me to go to hell."

"I considered it."

"Fair."

We walked in comfortable silence for a block.

"Jesse?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm scared too. That you'll change your mind. That this won't work. That I'm setting myself up to get hurt again."

I stopped walking, turned to face her under a streetlight. "I can't promise I won't screw up. I probably will. I'm learning how to do this—how to stay, how to communicate, how to fight fear instead of running from it. But I promise I'll try. I promise I'll be honest. And I promise that when I screw up, I'll own it and fix it instead of running away."

She searched my face. "That's all I can ask for."

"It's what you deserve."

We stood there for a moment, and I wanted so badly to kiss her. To close the distance and show her with actions instead of words how much I loved her.

But tonight wasn't about what I wanted. It was about what she needed.

So I stepped back, nodded toward her house down the street. "Come on. Let's get you home."

We walked the rest of the way in silence.

At her door, she turned to me. "Goodnight, Jesse."

"Goodnight, Harper."

She went inside, and I stood on her porch for a moment, looking up at the stars over Silver Ridge.

Then I walked back to Frank's house, where my packed duffel bag waited.

Time to unpack.

Time to stay.
