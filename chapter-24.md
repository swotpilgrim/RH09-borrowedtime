# Chapter 24: What He's Been Running From

Harper led me away from the festival crowds to the quiet behind the community center. The music faded to background noise. Just us in the growing dusk.

She turned to face me, arms crossed. "What did you want to talk about?"

The words I'd been rehearsing tangled in my throat. How did I explain that everything had changed watching her with those kids?

"I..." I stopped. "I need a minute."

Harper's jaw tightened. "Jesse, if you brought me back here just to tell me you're leaving—"

"I'm not. I mean, I don't know. I need to think."

"You've had all summer to think."

"I know. But about the wrong things."

Something shifted in her expression. "What do you mean?"

I paced. "Can you just... give me a minute? To figure out how to say this?"

Harper watched me, then nodded and sat on the back steps. Waiting.

I paced, trying to organize the revelation that had hit me out there watching her. Trying to put into words the pattern I'd finally seen clearly.

"I've been telling myself all summer that I'm someone who leaves," I started, the words coming slow. "That it's just who I am. In my nature. That I've got two years of proof that I can't stay put, so trying to stay would be setting both of us up for failure."

Harper didn't respond, just watched me pace.

"And I believed that." I stopped, turned to face her. "But watching you tonight with those kids, I realized something. It's not truth. It's trauma."

Her eyes widened.

"When my stepfather made it clear I wasn't wanted, something broke in me." The admission came out rough. "I learned I was disposable. So I started leaving first. If I was always the one leaving, I never had to be the one left behind."

Harper's expression softened slightly.

"I've been running for two years. Not from places or jobs. I've been running from the risk of being unwanted again." I met her eyes. "It wasn't because I couldn't stay. It was because staying meant risking rejection."

"Jesse—"

"Let me finish. Please." I took a breath. "But you know what? The worst thing isn't rejection. It's choosing loneliness over love because I'm too scared to try. It's running from the best thing that's ever happened to me because I'm protecting myself from pain that might never even come."

I paced again, pieces falling into place.

"You told me leaving isn't inevitable, it's a choice. You were right. I've been choosing to leave, calling it protection when it's just fear." I stopped, looked at her. "I've been doing to you exactly what my stepfather did to me. Rejecting before being rejected."

Harper's eyes were bright.

"And Harper, you haven't rejected me. You loved me. You fought for us. You saw through all my walls." My voice cracked. "This town hasn't rejected me. Frank offered me permanent work. Danny became my friend. No one's making me leave except me."

"So why have you been leaving?" Harper asked quietly.

"Because I've been more afraid of potentially failing than I've been willing to risk potentially succeeding." The truth of it was stark and painful. "What if I stay and it works? What if I'm capable of building something permanent, and I've just been too scared to try? What if my fear of failing at staying has kept me from discovering I could actually do it?"

I sat down on the steps beside her, not touching but close enough to feel the warmth of her presence.

"I don't have my stepfather's voice in my head anymore, telling me I'm unwanted," I said. "I have my own voice doing it. I've internalized the rejection so completely that I don't need anyone else to reject me. I do it to myself."

Harper was quiet for a moment. "Why are you telling me this now?"

"Because I saw you out there with those kids, and I realized something." I turned to look at her profile in the dim light. "I don't want to leave. I don't want to get in my truck tomorrow and drive to another nowhere town. I don't want to keep running from connection and calling it freedom. I want to stay here. With you. In this town. Building something real instead of something temporary."

Her breath caught.

"I'm terrified," I admitted. "I'm absolutely terrified of staying. Of trying and failing. Of eventually hurting you despite my best intentions. But you know what terrifies me more?" I waited until she looked at me. "Leaving. Spending the rest of my life wondering what would've happened if I'd just been brave enough to stay. Knowing I had this—us—and I threw it away because I was too scared to try."

"Jesse..." Her voice was soft, uncertain.

"I'm not saying I have all the answers. I don't know how to promise forever. I don't know if I'll be good at staying—I've never tried it before. I'm going to be scared. I'm probably going to have moments where the road calls me and I want to run." I reached for her hand tentatively. "But I want to try. For you. For us. For the possibility that maybe, just maybe, borrowed time can become real time if I'm brave enough to choose it."

Harper looked down at our joined hands. "What changed? Between yesterday when you were packing your truck and tonight?"

"I stopped focusing on the fear and started focusing on what I actually want." I squeezed her hand gently. "I want you, Harper. I want this town. I want Sunday dinners with your family and festival lights and building something permanent for the first time in my life. I want to stop running from the risk of pain and start running toward the possibility of happiness."

A tear slid down her cheek. "You hurt me, Jesse. These last few weeks, the distance, the uncertainty—it hurt."

"I know. I'm so sorry."

"And I can't go through that again. If you're going to stay, you have to actually choose it. Not maybe choose it. Not try it out and see. Actually commit to trying, even when it's scary. Even when you want to run."

"I know."

"I need honesty. If you're struggling, if you're scared, if the road is calling you—you have to tell me. We have to communicate instead of you pulling away and leaving me wondering what I did wrong."

"I can do that," I said. "I want to do that."

Harper turned to face me fully. "Are you sure? Because I've been where you are. I stood at that festival booth tonight sure you'd already left town, convincing myself I'd be okay. And then you showed up and I let myself hope again, and if you're not actually sure about this, if there's any part of you that's still planning to leave—"

"I'm sure." The certainty in my voice surprised even me. "I'm terrified, but I'm sure. I want to stay. I'm choosing to stay. Not because it's safe or easy, but because leaving would be worse. Because you're worth the risk. We're worth the risk."

She studied my face in the dim light, searching for truth or doubt or whatever she needed to see. I let her look, trying to show her with my eyes what my words might not be enough to convey.

Finally, she spoke. "What about Frank's job offer?"

"I'm taking it. If it's still available."

"And where will you live?"

"I'll find a place to rent. Figure it out as I go. I don't have all the details worked out, Harper. I just know I'm staying."

"What about when you get scared?"

"I'll probably get scared a lot," I admitted. "But I'll talk to you about it instead of running from it. I'll choose staying even when fear tells me to leave. I'll be honest instead of pulling away."

Harper's hand trembled in mine. "This is a lot."

"I know."

"I need to think about this. About whether I can trust you after everything."

The words stung, but they were fair. "I understand."

"I'm not saying no," she said quickly. "I'm just saying I need time to process. You've had this revelation, but I've been hurt. I need to know if I can trust that this is real, that you're not going to change your mind when the fear gets loud again."

"That's fair." I didn't let go of her hand. "Take all the time you need. I'll be here. That's the whole point—I'm not leaving."

We sat in silence for a moment, the festival noise a distant hum, our hands joined on the wooden step between us.

"I saw the moment it hit you," Harper said quietly. "Out there at the festival. I was watching you watching me, and I saw something change in your face."

"You saw me?"

"I've been aware of where you are since the moment you arrived. I always am." She smiled slightly, sad and knowing. "I saw you standing in the shadows. Saw the exact moment you realized something. What was it?"

"That I didn't want to belong anywhere else," I said simply. "That watching you belong here made me want to belong here too. With you."

Another tear slid down her cheek, and I reached up carefully to wipe it away with my thumb. She didn't pull back from the touch.

"I'm still scared," she whispered.

"Me too."

"But I want to believe you. I want this to be real."

"It is real." I moved closer, our shoulders touching. "I know I have to prove it. I know words aren't enough after how I've acted. But I will prove it, Harper. Day by day, choice by choice. I'll show you that I'm staying. That I choose you. That borrowed time is becoming real time because I'm finally brave enough to make it so."

She leaned her head on my shoulder, and I felt the tension drain from both of us.

"I love you," I said into her hair. "I should've said it before. Should've been brave enough to say it weeks ago. I love you, and I'm sorry it took me so long to choose you."

"I love you too," she whispered. "Even though you're infuriating and scared and took forever to figure this out."

I laughed, the sound shaky with relief. "Yeah. I did."

We sat there as the festival continued without us, and I felt something fundamental settle in my chest. The fear was still there—probably always would be. But it wasn't driving anymore.

I was.

And I was choosing to stay.
