# Chapter 27: Her Response

The kiss changed things.

Not everything—Harper was still careful, still protecting her heart. But the wall she'd built after our fight had cracks in it now, and through those cracks I could see the hope she was trying not to feel.

Monday morning, I showed up at her house before work. Early enough that the sun was just starting to paint the mountains gold.

She answered the door in her robe, hair sleep-tousled, surprise on her face.

"Jesse? What are you doing here?"

I held up a thermos. "Brought you coffee. Remembered you like it with cream, no sugar."

She took the thermos, something soft crossing her expression. "You remembered."

"I pay attention."

"You drove all the way here just to bring me coffee?"

"It's not that far. And I wanted to see you before work."

She leaned against the doorframe, studying me. "You're really doing this."

"Every day."

"Jesse..." She bit her lip. "Come in. Just for a minute."

I followed her inside to the kitchen. She poured the coffee into a mug, took a sip, closed her eyes.

"Perfect."

"Good."

She set down the mug, looked at me directly. "We need to talk. Really talk. About what this looks like. If we're doing this."

"Okay."

"I need to know you're in this. Not just trying it out. Not seeing how it goes." Her voice was steady but her hands trembled slightly. "I need to know that when things get hard—and they will get hard—you're not going to run."

"I won't run."

"How can you promise that? How can you know?"

I took a breath. "I can't know for certain. I can't promise I'll never be scared or never struggle. But I can promise that when I am scared, when I do struggle, I'll talk to you about it. I'll fight the fear instead of acting on it. I'll choose you over running."

"What if the fear wins?"

"Then you'll know. Because I'll be honest about it. I won't just disappear." I stepped closer. "Harper, I can't give you a guarantee that I'll never mess up. But I can give you my word that I'll fight like hell not to. And if I do mess up, I'll own it and fix it."

She searched my face. "This is a lot of trust you're asking for."

"I know. And I'm willing to earn it. However long that takes."

Harper picked up her coffee mug, took another sip, considering. "Okay. Here's what I need."

"Tell me."

"Honesty. Always. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard."

"You have it."

"Consistency. You showing up when you say you will. Following through."

"Done."

"Communication. You tell me when you're struggling. You don't pull away and make me guess what's wrong."

"I promise."

"And time." She met my eyes. "You give me time to rebuild trust. You don't rush me or push me or get frustrated when I'm still scared."

"As much time as you need."

She set down the mug. "And one more thing."

"Anything."

"You introduce me as your girlfriend. Not your friend. Not someone you're seeing. Your girlfriend. Because if we're doing this, we're doing it for real."

A smile tugged at my lips. "So we're doing this?"

"I think so. Maybe. If you're really sure."

"I'm sure."

"Even though it's terrifying?"

"Especially because it's terrifying. Because you're worth being terrified for."

Harper closed the distance between us and kissed me. Longer than yesterday, less tentative. When we broke apart, she was smiling.

"You're my boyfriend now."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Which means you have responsibilities."

"Like bringing you coffee in the morning?"

"Exactly like that." She glanced at the clock. "You're going to be late for work."

"Worth it."

I kissed her once more, quick and sweet, then headed to the door. She followed, still holding her coffee mug.

"Jesse?"

I turned.

"Thank you. For not giving up on us."

"Thank you for giving me another chance."

I drove to work with a stupid grin on my face, knowing I'd be teasing from Danny but not caring even a little.

That evening, Harper met me at my apartment after the community center closed. I'd cleaned the small space, tried to make it welcoming instead of just functional.

She brought food from the diner—burgers and fries that we ate sitting on my small couch.

"This place is very you," she observed, looking around.

"That good or bad?"

"Good. It's simple. Honest. No pretense."

"That's me. Simple and honest."

She laughed. "You're many things, Jesse Carter. Simple isn't one of them."

After we ate, she curled into my side, her head on my shoulder. We didn't talk much. Just existed together, the radio playing softly in the background.

"What are you thinking?" she asked eventually.

"That this is the first time I've had someone in a place that's mine. That I haven't shared space with anyone since I left home."

"How does it feel?"

"Good. Right." I played with a strand of her hair. "Like maybe I'm actually building something."

"You are building something. With me. With this town."

"Yeah."

She tilted her head up to look at me. "I'm still scared."

"Me too."

"But I'm also happy."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. For the first time since you started pulling away, I'm actually happy. Not just hoping or pretending. Actually happy."

I kissed her forehead. "Good. You deserve to be happy."

"So do you."

We stayed like that until Harper had to go home for dinner with her family. At the door, she turned back.

"My parents want to have you over for Sunday dinner. Officially. As my boyfriend."

My stomach flipped. "That's... big."

"It is. You don't have to if you're not ready."

"No, I want to. Just nervous about facing your father after everything."

"He likes you. Even when he was worried about us, he liked you." Harper squeezed my hand. "Besides, you already got his permission, remember? When he talked to you at the center?"

"Right. Yeah."

"So you'll come?"

"I'll be there."

She kissed me goodbye, and I watched from my doorway as she drove away, her taillights disappearing down the street.

Sunday dinner with her family. Like a normal boyfriend. Like someone who stays.

The thought terrified and thrilled me in equal measure.

The week passed in a new rhythm. Work during the day, community center in the afternoon, evenings with Harper. Sometimes we went to the diner, sometimes we drove to the overlook, sometimes we just sat in my apartment talking about everything and nothing.

Friday night, we went to the drive-in with Danny and Carol Ann again. This time, Harper sat close to me, my arm around her shoulders, her head on my chest. Normal couple things. Easy and comfortable in a way I'd never experienced.

"You two are disgustingly cute," Carol Ann declared during intermission.

"Says the girl currently sitting in her boyfriend's lap," Harper shot back.

"That's different. We've been together for months."

"So will we be, eventually," I said. The words came out before I thought about them.

Harper looked up at me. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. If you'll have me."

"I'll have you."

Danny groaned. "See? Disgustingly cute."

Sunday came, and I showed up at the Wells' house for dinner in my best shirt, flowers for Mrs. Wells in hand. My heart hammered as I knocked on the door.

Reverend Wells answered. "Jesse. Come in."

"Sir. Thank you for having me."

I handed the flowers to Mrs. Wells, who smiled warmly. "How thoughtful. I'll put these in water."

Dinner was less terrifying than I'd feared. The Reverend asked about my job, and I told him about Jensen Construction, about the crew, about the steady paycheck. Mrs. Wells asked about my apartment, and I described the small space I was learning to call home.

Harper sat beside me, her hand occasionally finding mine under the table, grounding me when I got nervous.

After dinner, the Reverend asked if I'd like to sit on the porch with him. Harper gave me an encouraging nod.

We sat in rocking chairs, evening settling over the town.

"You stayed," the Reverend said.

"Yes, sir."

"And you're committed to this? To my daughter?"

"Completely."

He was quiet for a moment. "When we talked before, you were afraid. Uncertain. What changed?"

"I stopped asking if I could stay and started asking what I wanted. And what I wanted was Harper. Was this life. So I chose it."

"Choosing once is easy. It's choosing every day that's hard."

"I know, sir. But I'm prepared for hard."

The Reverend rocked slowly. "I believe you are. I see it in how you show up. How you work. How you treat my daughter." He looked at me. "You have my blessing, Jesse. To court Harper properly. To build a life here. To be part of this community."

"Thank you, sir."

"Don't thank me. Just treat her right. Be the man you're capable of being."

"I will, sir."

Harper appeared in the doorway. "Everything okay out here?"

"Everything's fine," her father said. "Just having a talk."

She came and sat on the porch railing, between us. The Reverend smiled at his daughter, then at me.

"I think I'll go help your mother with the dishes. You two enjoy the evening."

He went inside, and Harper moved to sit beside me.

"What did he say?"

"That he gives us his blessing."

"Really?"

"Really."

She leaned against me, and I put my arm around her. We rocked gently, watching the town settle into night.

"Jesse?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm all in. With you. With us. I'm choosing this too."

I kissed the top of her head. "Good. Because I'm not going anywhere."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

And I meant it.

With everything I had, I meant it.
