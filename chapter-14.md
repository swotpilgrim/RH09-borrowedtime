# Chapter 14: Danny's Advice

Danny corners me during lunch break at a construction site in late July. We're sitting in the shade of Jesse's truck, eating sandwiches and trying to escape the midday heat.

"So," Danny says casually, but there's nothing casual about his tone. "You and Harper."

"What about us?"

"Come on, man. The whole town knows. Question is, what are you going to do about it?"

I set down my sandwich. "What do you mean?"

"I mean September's three weeks away. You planning to leave or stay?" Danny looks at me directly. "Because if you're leaving, you need to cut Harper loose now. And if you're staying, you need to make that clear to everyone, especially her."

"It's complicated."

"It's really not." Danny takes a drink from his canteen. "You either want to be here or you don't. Everything else is just fear talking."

"You don't understand—"

"I understand you're scared. I get it. Staying somewhere, committing to someone, risking being hurt or hurting them—that's terrifying. But you know what's more terrifying? Spending your whole life running from things that might hurt you and never having anything real."

I want to argue but Danny's not wrong. That's exactly what I've been doing—running from potential pain, guaranteeing loneliness to avoid possible heartbreak.

"I'm thinking about staying," I admit. "Frank offered me permanent work. I'm just not sure I can do it."

"Why not?"

"Because what if I try and fail? What if I stay for a while and then need to leave anyway?"

Danny shakes his head. "Man, you're looking at this all wrong. You're not asking if you can stay—you're asking if you're willing to try. Those are different questions."

"How?"

"Can you stay assumes there's some fundamental thing about you that makes staying impossible. Are you willing to try just asks if you want it enough to risk it." He finishes his sandwich, crumples the wrapper. "You know what I was scared of when Carol Ann and I started getting serious?"

"What?"

"I was scared I'd end up like my dad—working the same job in the same town my whole life, never seeing anything beyond Silver Ridge. I thought being with Carol Ann meant giving up on adventure, on possibilities." He pauses. "You know what I figured out?"

"What?"

"That building something with someone you love is its own adventure. That having roots doesn't mean being stuck—it means having a foundation to build from." Danny looks at me seriously. "My dad's not trapped in Silver Ridge. He chose it. He built a life here, raised a family here, created something that matters. That's not settling. That's succeeding."

The perspective shift is subtle but significant. I've been thinking of staying as settling, as giving up possibilities. Danny's suggesting it's creating something instead of constantly searching for it.

"But what if I'm not good at it? At staying, I mean."

"What if you are and you've just never tried?" Danny claps my shoulder. "Look, you've spent two years proving you can leave places. Maybe it's time to find out if you can stay."

"You make it sound simple."

"It is simple. Not easy, but simple." He stands, stretches. "Harper's worth trying for. This town's worth trying for. Hell, you're worth trying for. Stop acting like staying is some impossible thing and just do it."

"You sound like Harper."

"Harper's a smart girl. You should listen to her." Danny grins. "And to me. We're both telling you the same thing."

We head back to work, but Danny's words stick with me through the afternoon. Stop acting like staying is impossible and just do it. Like it's a choice, not a capability issue.

That evening after work, Frank asks me to stay for a minute before I head to the community center.

"Been meaning to talk to you," he says, settling into a kitchen chair. "About that fall work I mentioned."

"Yeah?"

"Project starts first week of September. School expansion, going to take four months minimum, maybe longer." He looks at me directly. "Need to know if you're in. Can't hold the spot forever."

This is it—the moment where I have to actually decide instead of just thinking about deciding.

"Can I have a few days? To think about it?"

"Few days, sure. But Jesse—you been here two months. If you don't know by now whether you want to stay, you probably never will."

He's not wrong. I've had eight weeks to figure this out. Another few days won't change the fundamental question.

"You think I could do it?" I ask. "Stay somewhere, I mean. Build something permanent."

Frank considers this. "I think you've been doing it for two months already. You show up on time, do good work, people depend on you. You've made friends, got involved with the community center, carved out a place here." He pauses. "Only difference between what you've been doing and permanent is whether you choose to keep doing it."

"But what if I fail?"

"Then you fail. At least you tried." Frank stands, rinses his coffee mug. "You know what's sadder than trying and failing? Never trying because you're too scared to fail."

Everyone's saying the same thing—Danny, Harper, Frank. Stop being scared and try. Take the risk. Find out if staying is possible.

They all believe I can do it. The question is whether I believe it.

That night at the community center, I watch Harper work with the kids. She's teaching them a game, laughing when they get it wrong, patient when they don't understand. She looks up, catches me watching, smiles.

That smile makes the decision simpler.

I want to stay. Not just for Harper, though she's a big part of it. But for this—for belonging somewhere, for being part of something, for having people who expect me to show up because I matter to them.

For having a home instead of just a series of temporary stops.

Danny said Harper's worth trying for, the town's worth trying for, I'm worth trying for. He's right on all counts.

So I'm going to try.

After the kids leave, I find Harper putting away supplies.

"I'm going to tell Frank yes," I say. "About the fall work. About staying."

Harper freezes, then slowly turns to face me. "Are you sure?"

"I'm terrified. But yeah, I'm sure."

She crosses the room, stops in front of me. "Why?"

"Because I want to. Because I'm tired of running. Because you and Danny and Frank all seem to think I can do this, and maybe it's time I believe you." I take a breath. "And because I want to see what happens with us if we have more than three weeks."

Harper's eyes are bright. "You're really staying?"

"I'm really going to try."

She hugs me then—quick and fierce—and I hold her, breathing in the scent of her shampoo, feeling the solidness of her in my arms.

"This is really scary," I admit.

"I know. But you're brave enough."

"I hope you're right."

"I am." She pulls back, looks up at me. "You're going to be amazing at this."

I'm not sure I believe that. But I'm willing to find out.

And that, apparently, is all it takes to stop running and start building.
