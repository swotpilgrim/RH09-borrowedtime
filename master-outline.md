# MASTER OUTLINE: Borrowed Time
## Part 1 - Chapters 1-10

## Chapter 1: Rolling Into Town

Jesse Carter drives his beat-up Chevy truck into Silver Ridge, Colorado, on a hot June morning in 1957. He's eighteen and has been on the road for two years since leaving home. His uncle Frank offered him construction work for the summer, and Jesse figures it's just another temporary stop. He's learned to travel light, keep moving, and not get attached to places or people. As he pulls up to Frank's small house on the working-class side of town, Jesse takes in the mountain-ringed town and reminds himself this is borrowed time—three months, then he's gone. Frank greets him with a handshake and few words, shows him the spare room, and tells him work starts Monday. Jesse unpacks his single duffel bag and stares at the unfamiliar walls, already counting down to September.

## Chapter 2: The Uncle's Rules

Jesse's first weekend in Silver Ridge. Frank takes him to Sunday service at the community center chapel, making it clear that attending church and volunteering at the center are expectations if Jesse's staying under his roof. Jesse's not religious, but he's learned not to argue with free room and board. He observes the town during service—the respectable families, the social hierarchy, the way everyone knows everyone. After service, Frank introduces him to Reverend Wells and mentions Jesse will be helping with the youth programs. Jesse meets Harper Wells briefly, the minister's daughter with warm eyes and an easy smile. She welcomes him genuinely, treating him like he belongs when he knows he doesn't. Jesse's struck by her but reminds himself she's temporary too, just part of the scenery.

## Chapter 3: First Day on the Job

Monday morning, Jesse reports to Frank's construction site. He meets Danny Pritchard, a local guy his age who works the crew and immediately tries to befriend him. Jesse's competent with tools, works hard, and keeps his head down. Danny chatters about the town, points out landmarks, mentions his girlfriend Carol Ann, and asks Jesse questions he deflects. During lunch break, Danny asks how long Jesse's staying. "Just the summer," Jesse says, and Danny shrugs, says that's too bad, he seems like good people. Jesse's used to being temporary, but something about Danny's easy acceptance catches him off guard. After work, Frank tells him he did good work. Jesse realizes he wants to do right by Frank, at least while he's here. It's the closest thing to family he's had in two years.

## Chapter 4: Community Center Volunteer

Jesse's first afternoon volunteering at the community center. Harper runs the summer youth programs—sports, crafts, tutoring—and she's got a natural way with kids that makes them listen and laugh. She puts Jesse to work fixing broken equipment, organizing supplies, supervising the basketball court. He watches her move through the space, making everyone feel seen and valued, including him. When a kid asks if Jesse's Harper's boyfriend, she laughs and says he's new in town, helping out. Jesse finds himself wishing the kid's assumption were true, then shuts that down fast. After the session, Harper thanks him, asks if he'll be back. He says he'll be here all summer—his uncle's requirement. She smiles and says she's glad, they can use the help. Jesse leaves thinking about her smile more than he should.

## Chapter 5: Keeping Distance

Jesse's second week in Silver Ridge. He establishes his routine: construction work with Frank's crew during the day, community center in the afternoons, keeping to himself in the evenings. He's friendly but guarded, answering questions without revealing much. Danny keeps trying to crack through Jesse's walls, inviting him to hang out, but Jesse demurs. He notices Harper at the center, notices how she treats everyone with the same kindness, notices her laugh. He tells himself not to get attached—to her, to this place, to anything. One afternoon, Harper asks where he's from. Jesse gives vague answers about moving around. She doesn't push, just says it must be interesting seeing different places. Jesse realizes she's not judging his rootlessness; she's curious about it. That's more dangerous than judgment. He reminds himself: three months, then gone.

## Chapter 6: Her Questions

Harper starts asking Jesse about his travels. Not prying questions about why he left home, but genuine curiosity about the places he's been, the jobs he's worked, what different towns are like. Jesse finds himself talking more than he means to, describing a desert town in Arizona, a coastal village in Oregon, a ranch in Montana. Harper listens like his stories matter, asks follow-up questions, seems fascinated by his experience of America beyond Silver Ridge. She admits she's never left Colorado, barely left this town except for school trips. Her family expects her to stay, probably marry someone local, settle down. When she talks about the mountains surrounding Silver Ridge, Jesse hears both love and restlessness in her voice. He recognizes it—the feeling of being trapped even in a beautiful place. For the first time, Jesse wants to show someone the world beyond their horizon.

## Chapter 7: Her Dreams

Late afternoon at the community center after the kids leave. Harper and Jesse clean up together, and she asks what his favorite place has been. Jesse describes the California coast at sunset, how the ocean goes on forever. Harper's eyes light up—she's never seen the ocean, only pictures in books. She confesses she dreams about traveling, seeing everything she's read about, but her parents expect her to stay close. She feels guilty for wanting more than Silver Ridge. Jesse tells her there's nothing wrong with wanting to see the world; her parents just want her safe. Harper says maybe, but sometimes safe feels like small. Jesse understands that completely. He finds himself wanting to take her everywhere, show her the ocean and deserts and big cities. Then he remembers he's leaving in September, and offering her those things would be cruel. Harper must see something in his expression because she changes the subject, but the moment lingers between them.

## Chapter 8: Spending Time Together

Late June, and Jesse's spending more time with Harper beyond required volunteering. They hike mountain trails on weekends, Harper showing him overlooks and hidden spots she's known since childhood. They get milkshakes at the diner after center sessions, sit in booths and talk while the jukebox plays Elvis and Buddy Holly. Harper tells him about growing up in a fishbowl where everyone watches, knows your business, has expectations. Jesse tells her about the freedom of the road, but also the loneliness of never belonging anywhere. They're honest with each other in ways Jesse hasn't been with anyone in two years. Danny notices, makes teasing comments about Jesse and Harper. Jesse deflects, but he's aware the town's starting to notice too. He sees Reverend Wells watching them with concern. Jesse knows he should pull back, but Harper makes it impossible. She's light and warmth in his transient existence.

## Chapter 9: The Overlook

Jesse and Harper drive to the overlook above town one evening after the center closes. You can see for miles from up there—mountains, valleys, the ribbon of highway leading away. Harper says this is her thinking spot, where she comes when Silver Ridge feels too small. Jesse understands—for him, the thinking spot is the road itself, always moving toward somewhere else. They sit on the truck bed watching sunset paint the sky. Harper asks what Jesse's running from. He's startled by her directness. She says she's not judging, just recognizing something familiar—his need to leave looks like her need to go, just acted on. Jesse admits his stepfather made it clear he wasn't wanted, so he left before he was thrown out. Harper's quiet, then says maybe he's not running from something but toward something, he just hasn't found it yet. The conversation shifts something between them. Jesse realizes Harper sees him, really sees him. That's more terrifying than being invisible.

## Chapter 10: Falling

Early July, and Jesse admits to himself what he's been fighting for weeks: he's falling in love with Harper Wells. It's in the way she laughs at his dry jokes, how she trusts him with the kids at the center, the conversations that stretch into evening. It's how she looks at him like he matters, like he's not just passing through. It's the fact that for the first time since leaving home, Jesse doesn't want to be anywhere else. He wants to stay in this moment, this town, with this girl. The realization terrifies him. He's got eight weeks before he planned to leave, no permanent job, no reason to stay beyond her, and no idea how to be someone who stays anyway. That night, lying in Frank's spare room, Jesse stares at the ceiling and knows he's in trouble. He's fallen for a girl he's supposed to leave, in a town that's supposed to be temporary. Wanting to stay and knowing how to stay are two different things, and Jesse's only ever known how to go.

## Chapter 11: July Heat

Mid-July brings scorching heat to Silver Ridge, and Jesse's feelings for Harper intensify alongside the temperature. They spend long afternoons at the community center, evenings on mountain trails where it's cooler. The town's definitely noticed—Jesse catches knowing looks at the diner, hears whispered conversations that stop when he approaches. Danny outright asks if Jesse and Harper are together. Jesse says they're friends, but Danny laughs and says nobody looks at a friend the way Jesse looks at Harper. Frank mentions casually that the Reverend asked about Jesse's intentions, his plans after summer. Jesse freezes—he doesn't have intentions beyond leaving, doesn't have plans beyond the road. That evening, Harper mentions her father asking questions too. She tries to keep it light, but Jesse sees the worry underneath. They're running out of summer, and everyone knows it. Jesse wants to promise her something, but he doesn't know what he can promise when he's terrified he'll leave anyway.

## Chapter 12: What He Wants vs. What He Knows

Jesse lies awake analyzing what staying would require. He'd need a permanent job—construction work exists in Silver Ridge, but Frank's crew is seasonal and small. He'd need a place to live beyond Frank's spare room. He'd need to commit to a town where he's still the outsider, where Harper's family has concerns, where everyone would watch to see if he's worth her. Most terrifying: he'd need to trust that he won't eventually revert to drifting, that he won't wake up one morning needing the road and hurt Harper worse than leaving now would. Jesse wants to stay, wants Harper, wants this life he's glimpsed with her. But wanting and knowing how are different. He's spent two years proving he's someone who leaves. One summer with Harper doesn't change his fundamental nature. Or does it? Jesse doesn't know, and the uncertainty paralyzes him. He's caught between desire and fear, unable to move in either direction.

## Chapter 13: Harper's Awareness

Harper's not blind to Jesse's internal struggle. She sees him pull back when conversations turn to fall plans, notices how he changes subject when she mentions September. After a community center session, she confronts him gently. She knows he's planning to leave when summer ends—he's never hidden that. She's tried to protect her heart by keeping perspective, but she needs honesty from him. Is he interested in her or just passing time? Jesse's torn between protecting them both by pulling away and being truthful about feelings he can't back up with commitment. He tells her he cares about her, more than he should given he's leaving. Harper asks why he has to leave if he doesn't want to. Jesse struggles to articulate his fear—that even if he tries to stay, he'll fail at it. Harper deserves someone who knows how to stay, not someone who'll eventually run. Harper's quiet, then says maybe she should be allowed to decide what she deserves. But she doesn't push. The conversation ends unresolved, hanging between them.

## Chapter 14: Danny's Advice

Jesse finally opens up to Danny during lunch break at a construction site. Danny listens to Jesse's fear that staying will end badly, that he'll hurt Harper eventually. Danny asks bluntly: what if Jesse's wrong? What if the reason he's always left before is because he never had a reason to stay, and Harper's giving him that reason? Jesse argues that wanting to stay and being able to stay are different. Danny points out that nobody knows how to do anything until they try, and love's worth trying for. He mentions his own girlfriend, Carol Ann, how committing to her scared him but turned out to be the best decision he made. Danny says Jesse's fear is understandable but doesn't have to be destiny. Leaving to avoid possible pain guarantees definite pain. Jesse knows Danny's right, but knowledge doesn't dissolve fear. After work, Frank mentions quietly that running's easier than staying, but easier doesn't mean better. Jesse realizes even his taciturn uncle is weighing in. Everyone sees what Jesse's fighting.

## Chapter 15: The Question She Doesn't Ask

Late July evening at the overlook. Harper and Jesse watch stars emerge over the mountains. The conversation turns to fall—Harper will be a senior, has college applications to consider though her parents want her close. Jesse deflects questions about his plans, and Harper finally asks directly: Is there any version of September where he stays? Jesse wants to say yes, wants to promise her everything, but fear chokes the words. He tells her he doesn't know how to stay, that he's terrified of trying and failing. Harper's eyes fill with hurt she tries to hide. She says she understands, that she knew from the start he was temporary. But Jesse hears the unasked question underneath: Am I not worth trying for? The drive back to town is quiet. Harper thanks him for honesty, says she needs to think about what she's doing, whether she can handle loving someone on borrowed time. Jesse watches her walk into her house and knows he's hurting her by not being brave enough to risk staying. But the fear of hurting her worse later paralyzes him.

## Chapter 16: Midpoint - She's Fallen Too

Carol Ann corners Jesse at the diner a few days later. She's Harper's best friend and protective of her, and she tells Jesse plainly that Harper's fallen for him despite trying not to. Carol Ann's not gentle—she says if Jesse's leaving anyway, he needs to cut Harper loose now, not string her along until September rips them apart. Jesse realizes what he's known but avoided admitting: Harper loves him. It's not just attraction or summer fun; she's fallen as hard as he has. Carol Ann asks what Jesse's going to do about it. He doesn't have an answer. She tells him Harper's worth more than borrowed time, and if he can't give her real time, he should let her go. After Carol Ann leaves, Jesse sits in the booth paralyzed. He's reached the midpoint of summer and the crisis point of his heart. Harper's given him what he's wanted since leaving home—someone who sees him, values him, makes him feel like home. And he's going to leave her because he's too afraid to trust himself. The realization makes him sick.

## Chapter 17: Trying to Let Her Go

Jesse attempts to create distance, thinking he's protecting Harper. He takes extra shifts with Frank, claims he's busy when she suggests hiking, keeps conversations at the community center brief and friendly. Harper doesn't call him on it directly, but he sees the hurt and confusion in her eyes. After a week of this, Harper asks if she did something wrong. Jesse hates himself for making her doubt herself. He tells her she didn't do anything wrong; he's just trying to be realistic about September. Harper's face closes off. She says fine, she'll be realistic too, and stops seeking him out. The distance Jesse created to protect them both feels like punishment. He sees Harper at the center being her normal warm self with everyone except him—with him, she's polite and distant. Jesse got what he thought he wanted, and it's miserable. Danny tells him he's an idiot. Frank shakes his head in disappointment. Jesse knows they're right.

## Chapter 18: The Festival Announcement

The town announces the end-of-summer festival for late August—the big social event before school starts, with live music, dancing, games, and community gathering. Harper's helping organize, and the center kids are excited. Jesse realizes the festival falls right before his planned departure, that it'll be the last big event before he leaves. At the center, one of the kids asks if Jesse's taking Harper to the festival. Before he can answer, Harper says coolly that Jesse's probably leaving before then. The kid looks confused—festival's only a month away. Jesse sees hurt flash across Harper's face before she turns away. That evening, Jesse looks at his truck, already mentally packed, and feels the weight of his choice. He could take Harper to the festival, spend one perfect night with her, then leave. Or he could leave before the festival, make the break clean. Neither option feels right because the only right option—staying—terrifies him too much to reach for.

## Chapter 19: Her Father's Conversation

Reverend Wells asks Jesse to stay after a community center session. He's direct but not unkind—he's watched Jesse with Harper all summer, sees they care for each other, but he's also aware Jesse's planning to leave. The Reverend says he won't forbid his daughter from seeing Jesse, but he needs to know Jesse's intentions. Does Jesse plan to stay, or is he going to break Harper's heart? Jesse respects the Reverend too much to lie. He admits he cares about Harper but doesn't know if he's capable of staying, that his track record suggests he's not someone who stays. The Reverend is quiet, then says knowing your past doesn't mean accepting it as your future. He asks Jesse to consider what he's running from versus what he's running toward. The conversation ends with the Reverend saying he trusts Jesse to do right by Harper, whatever that means. Jesse leaves knowing he's been given permission but also responsibility. The question remains: what is doing right by Harper?

## Chapter 20: August Arrival

August arrives with Jesse's departure looming. His truck's been repaired, runs better than it has in months. He's got money saved from construction work. September is three weeks away. The practical obstacles to leaving are gone, but the emotional obstacles have multiplied. Harper maintains polite distance at the center, and Jesse misses her desperately. He watches her with the kids, sees her throw herself into festival planning, notices she's not smiling as much. Danny tells him Harper's been crying to Carol Ann. Jesse feels like he's already hurt her as much as staying and eventually leaving would have. Frank mentions there's potential for permanent construction work if Jesse wanted it—expansion projects planned for fall. Jesse realizes Frank's offering him a practical reason to stay, removing one excuse. But the fear remains: what if he accepts, stays for Harper, and still ends up leaving because that's who he is? The risk feels impossible, but so does leaving her.

## Chapter 21: Crisis - The Fight

Jesse and Harper have their first real fight at the community center after a session. Harper's reached her limit with his avoidance and mixed signals. She tells him she's tired of trying to figure out what he wants, tired of being treated like borrowed time. If he's leaving, fine—leave. But stop acting like leaving is inevitable when it's a choice he's making. Jesse argues it's not that simple, that he's trying to protect them both. Harper says leaving isn't protection, it's fear. She calls him out for hiding behind his past as an excuse not to risk his future. Jesse, defensive, says she doesn't understand what it's like to be unwanted, to learn not to count on staying anywhere. Harper counters that he's making her feel unwanted right now, that he's choosing to believe he's not worth keeping instead of believing she knows what she wants. The argument ends with Harper in tears, telling Jesse she loves him but she can't fight his fear for him. She walks away, and Jesse stands frozen, her words echoing: she loves him.

## Chapter 22: The Packing

Jesse starts packing his truck in earnest. He tells himself leaving is the right choice, that he's protecting Harper from inevitable disappointment. Frank watches silently, doesn't offer opinion. Danny stops by and calls Jesse a coward, says running now is the same as being sent away by his stepfather—he's doing to himself what he feared others would do. Jesse argues he's being realistic. Danny says he's being afraid, and there's a difference. That night, Jesse lies in the spare room staring at his packed duffel bag. He imagines driving away from Silver Ridge, Harper watching from her window, the mountains disappearing in his rearview mirror. He imagines months from now, working some other temporary job in some other town, thinking about the girl he left behind. He imagines Harper with someone else eventually, someone brave enough to stay. Each image feels like a knife. But the image of staying and eventually leaving, hurting her worse—that's the knife that cuts deepest. Jesse doesn't sleep, caught between fear and love, paralyzed by choice.

## Chapter 23: The Festival

The end-of-summer festival arrives on the last Saturday of August. Jesse planned to skip it, to leave before the event, but Frank tells him not to be a coward—at least say goodbye properly. Jesse goes, stands on the edges watching Silver Ridge celebrate summer's end. He sees Harper across the festival grounds, wearing a blue dress, working the youth center booth with the kids she's spent the summer teaching. She's smiling, laughing with them, and Jesse's chest aches watching her. She hasn't seen him yet. Jesse watches her help a little girl with a craft project, watches her high-five a boy who wins a game, watches her be the warmhearted person he fell in love with. The kids adore her. The town respects her. She belongs here in a way Jesse never has. And yet, he doesn't want to belong anywhere else. He doesn't want to see any other town, meet any other girl. He wants this place, this life, her. The realization hits him like a physical blow.

## Chapter 24: What He's Been Running From

Jesse finds a quiet spot behind the community center building, away from the festival noise, and forces himself to examine his fear honestly. He's been telling himself he'll inevitably leave because that's who he is. But watching Harper, Jesse realizes that's not truth—it's trauma. His stepfather made him feel disposable, so Jesse became someone who disposes of things first, who leaves before being left. He's been running not from places or people but from the risk of being unwanted again. Harper wants him. This town has made space for him. Frank offered him permanent work. What if the problem isn't that Jesse can't stay, but that he's been too afraid to try? What if his fear of failing at staying has kept him from discovering he could succeed at it? Jesse thinks about Harper's words during their fight: leaving isn't inevitable, it's a choice. He's choosing fear over love. He's choosing protection over possibility. He's doing to Harper and himself exactly what his stepfather did to him—rejecting before being rejected.

## Chapter 25: Danny's Final Push

Danny finds Jesse behind the building. He doesn't ask what Jesse's doing hiding during the festival; he just sits beside him. After a long silence, Danny says he knows Jesse's planning to leave soon, probably tomorrow. Jesse doesn't deny it. Danny tells him a story about when he first started dating Carol Ann—he was terrified of commitment, of being tied down, of losing his freedom. He almost ended things because fear felt safer than risk. Then he realized that losing Carol Ann would hurt infinitely more than risking his heart with her ever could. Danny says Jesse's at that same crossroads: certain pain by leaving, or possible pain by staying. But possible pain comes with possible joy, possible love, possible life. Certain pain just comes with loneliness. Danny stands, tells Jesse that Harper's worth the risk, and that Jesse's stronger than he thinks. He walks back toward the festival, leaving Jesse alone with his choice. Jesse knows Danny's right. The question is whether Jesse's brave enough to act on that knowledge.

## Chapter 26: Finding Her

Jesse walks back into the festival with his heart pounding. He finds Harper at the youth center booth, and when she sees him, her expression closes off—she's expecting goodbye. Jesse asks if they can talk. Harper's reluctant, says there's nothing left to say, but Jesse pleads. They walk away from the crowds to the overlook where they've shared so many conversations. The sun's setting over the mountains, painting everything gold. Jesse's hands are shaking. He tells Harper he's sorry for being a coward, for hurting her, for letting fear drive him. He admits he's spent two years running because staying meant risking rejection, and he's been rejected enough. But watching her at the festival, he realized leaving isn't protecting either of them—it's choosing fear over love. Harper's quiet, waiting. Jesse takes a breath and tells her: he's not leaving. He's terrified, doesn't know how to build a permanent life, but he wants to try. For her. For them. For the possibility of something real.

## Chapter 27: Her Response

Harper's silent for a long moment, and Jesse's terrified she'll tell him it's too late, that he's hurt her too much. But then she asks what changed. Jesse admits watching her with the kids at the festival, realizing he doesn't want to see any other place without her, doesn't want to be anywhere she's not. He's tired of running from pain that might never come. He'd rather risk heartbreak with her than guarantee loneliness without her. Harper's eyes fill with tears. She asks if he's sure, because she can't do this if he's going to change his mind in a month or a year. Jesse tells her honestly: he can't promise forever because he doesn't know how to promise that. But he can promise honesty, effort, and choosing to stay even when fear tells him to run. Harper says that's enough. She doesn't need guarantees; she needs someone willing to try. Jesse reaches for her hand, and she lets him take it. They stand on the overlook as the sun sets, and for the first time in two years, Jesse feels like he's stopped running.

## Chapter 28: The Kiss

Harper asks what staying looks like practically. Jesse tells her Frank offered permanent construction work, and he's going to take it. He'll figure out housing, build a life in Silver Ridge, prove to her parents he's serious. Harper warns him it won't be easy—the town will watch, her father will have expectations, people will doubt him. Jesse says he knows, and he's scared, but losing her scares him more. Harper smiles, the first real smile she's given him in weeks. She tells him she loves him, has loved him all summer despite trying not to. Jesse says it back—he loves her, more than he knew was possible, enough to try something he's never done before: stay. They kiss as the stars come out over Colorado, and Jesse feels something shift fundamentally inside him. This isn't borrowed time anymore. This is his life, his choice, his home. When they break apart, Harper's laughing and crying simultaneously. Jesse wipes her tears and promises he's not going anywhere. For the first time, that promise doesn't terrify him—it feels right.

## Chapter 29: Facing the Town

Jesse and Harper return to the festival together, holding hands. The town notices immediately—whispers spread through the crowd. Carol Ann sees them and grins, gives Harper a knowing look. Danny claps Jesse on the shoulder, says it's about time. Frank nods approval from where he's standing with other men. Reverend and Mrs. Wells watch from near the bandstand, and Jesse knows he'll have to face them soon, explain his intentions properly. But first, Harper pulls him toward the dance floor where a local band plays rockabilly. Jesse's not much of a dancer, but Harper doesn't care. They move together under string lights while the town watches, and Jesse realizes he's not an outsider anymore—he's choosing to be part of this community. It's terrifying and exhilarating simultaneously. After the dance, Jesse approaches Reverend Wells. Man to man, he tells the Reverend he's staying, that he loves Harper and plans to build a life here, that he'll work to prove himself worthy. The Reverend studies him, then extends his hand. He says Jesse's welcome in Silver Ridge, and welcome in their family, as long as he treats Harper right. Jesse promises he will.

## Chapter 30: Borrowed Time Becomes Real

September arrives, but Jesse doesn't leave. He unpacks his truck, takes the permanent position with Frank's crew, and starts looking for his own place. Harper begins her senior year, and they navigate being an official couple in a small town where everyone watches. It's not always easy—Jesse's fear of leaving resurfaces sometimes, and Harper has to remind him he chose this. But gradually, those fears quiet. Jesse finds rhythm in permanence: same job, same town, same girl. He meets Harper after school, helps at the community center, has dinner with her family on Sundays. Danny becomes a true friend, not just a work buddy. Frank's spare room becomes a launching point, not a way station. By October, Jesse realizes he's not counting days until he leaves—he's building toward a future. One evening at the overlook, Harper asks if he's happy. Jesse considers the question honestly. Happy's not the right word—he's still scared sometimes, still learning how to stay. But he's home. For the first time since his mother remarried, he's home. He tells Harper that borrowed time became real time the moment he chose her over fear. She leans against him, and they watch the stars over mountains that no longer feel like walls but like protection. Jesse's truck sits in Frank's driveway, no longer an escape vehicle but just transportation. The road's still out there, but Jesse's not running toward it anymore. He's exactly where he wants to be: beside the girl who taught him that staying is braver than leaving, and that love is worth the risk of pain. They kiss under the Colorado stars, and Jesse knows that this—this moment, this girl, this life—is what he was running toward all along. He just had to stop running to find it.
