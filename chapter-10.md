# Chapter 10: Falling

Early July, and I've stopped lying to myself.

I'm in love with Harper Wells.

It's not a sudden realization—more like admitting something I've known for weeks but refused to acknowledge. But lying in Frank's spare room one night in early July, staring at that water stain on the ceiling while the transistor radio plays low, I finally let myself think the words.

I'm in love with her.

I'm in love with the way she laughs at my dry jokes, throwing her head back with complete abandon. The way she treats the kids at the community center with patience and genuine affection, remembering details about each one. How she asks me questions like my answers matter, like she actually wants to know who I am beneath the surface.

I'm in love with her honesty, her dreams, her restlessness that mirrors my own. The way she sees Silver Ridge—loving it and feeling trapped by it simultaneously. How she understands running even though she's never left.

I'm in love with the quiet moments—sitting on the overlook watching sunsets, walking main street after the shops close, the comfortable silences between conversations. The way she doesn't need me to be anyone other than exactly who I am.

The realization should terrify me. I've got eight weeks until my planned departure. Eight weeks until I pack my truck and point it toward wherever looks good, leaving Silver Ridge and Harper Wells in my rearview mirror like I've left everywhere and everyone else for the past two years.

Eight weeks isn't enough time to fall in love with someone. Isn't enough time to build something that matters.

Except I have fallen in love, and it does matter, and eight weeks suddenly feels both infinite and impossibly short.

At the community center Wednesday afternoon, I watch Harper organize craft activities. She's wearing a yellow sundress, her hair loose around her shoulders, and she's teaching a group of kids how to make paper flowers. Her patience is remarkable—showing the same fold three times to a little boy who can't quite get it, praising each child's attempts even when the flowers look nothing like flowers.

One of the kids asks if I can help with the basketball hoop—someone's knocked it loose again. I grab tools from the supply closet and head outside. Through the window I can see Harper inside, surrounded by kids, completely in her element.

This is what she wants to do with her life, I realize. Not necessarily running youth programs in Silver Ridge—but working with kids, teaching, nurturing. She'd be incredible at it anywhere. Could run programs in Denver or San Francisco or anywhere she dreams of going.

But she's stuck here because she can't bring herself to disappoint the people who expect her to stay.

And I'm leaving here because I can't bring herself to risk staying somewhere.

We're both trapped, just like she said that night at the overlook. Different cages, same result.

After the kids leave, Harper finds me cleaning up the outdoor equipment.

"You've been quiet today," she observes.

"Just thinking."

"About?"

About you, I want to say. About how I don't want to leave in eight weeks. About how the thought of driving away from Silver Ridge makes my chest ache in ways that terrify me.

"Just thinking," I repeat.

Harper doesn't push, but I can tell she knows there's more I'm not saying. She's learned to read me, learned when I'm avoiding and when I genuinely have nothing to add. It's both comforting and unnerving, being known that well.

"Walk with me?" she asks.

We end up at the park, sitting on swings while the July evening cools around us. Kids played here earlier—I can see the evidence in disturbed woodchips and abandoned toys. Now it's empty except for us.

Harper pushes gently on her swing, feet barely leaving the ground. "Do you ever think about what it would be like if things were different?"

"Different how?"

"If you weren't leaving. If I wasn't stuck. If we'd met under circumstances where there wasn't a deadline hanging over everything." She looks at me. "Do you think about that?"

"Every day," I admit. The honesty surprises me, but I'm tired of deflecting with Harper. She deserves truth. "I think about what it would be like to stay. To have more than eight weeks."

"What stops you?"

"Fear, mostly. Fear that I'll try to stay and fail. That I'll prove I'm exactly what my stepfather thought I was—someone not worth keeping around."

"Jesse, you know that's not true."

"Do I? Because here's what I know: I'm eighteen years old with no permanent address, no family who wants me, no track record of staying anywhere. I work temporary jobs and live in other people's spare rooms and own exactly one duffel bag worth of possessions." I stop the swing, turn to face her. "That's not someone you build a life with. That's someone who leaves."

"That's someone who's been leaving because he doesn't know how to stay." Harper stops her swing too. "There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"Yes." She says it with complete certainty. "You're not someone who leaves because that's who you are. You're someone who leaves because that's what you've learned to do. You can learn something different."

"What if I can't?"

"What if you can?" She meets my eyes. "What if you stayed and it worked out? What if you're actually good at it and you've just never given yourself the chance to find out?"

The possibility hangs in the air between us. What if I stayed? What if I took Frank up on his offer of permanent work? What if I stopped running and started building something here in Silver Ridge?

What if I stayed for Harper?

"I'm scared," I say quietly.

"I know. I'm scared too." Harper's voice is soft. "I'm scared that you'll leave and I'll never meet anyone else who sees me the way you do. I'm scared that I'll stay in Silver Ridge forever and wake up at forty never having taken any risks. I'm scared that we're letting fear decide everything for us."

"What do we do about it?"

"I don't know. But I know that in eight weeks you're going to drive away, and I'm going to stay here, and we're both going to wonder what would have happened if we'd been braver."

She's right. I can already feel the regret that's coming, can imagine myself six months from now working some job in some other town and thinking about Harper Wells and the summer in Silver Ridge when I almost stayed.

"I don't want to hurt you," I say.

"I know. But leaving will hurt too. So will staying. There's no option that doesn't hurt." She reaches over, takes my hand. "The question is which hurt comes with which possibility."

Her hand is warm in mine, and I'm struck by how natural this feels—sitting on swings holding hands with a girl I've known less than two months but who somehow knows me better than anyone ever has.

"I've never felt this way about anyone," I admit.

"Me neither."

"I don't know what to do about it."

"Me neither." Harper squeezes my hand. "But we've got eight weeks to figure it out."

Eight weeks. It sounds like forever and no time at all.

We sit there as darkness falls, still holding hands, neither of us ready to let go. Fireflies start to appear in the grass around us, blinking like fallen stars. Someone's playing a radio nearby—Patsy Cline singing about crazy for thinking love would last.

I think about Danny's warning, about Frank's subtle reminder that Harper's the minister's daughter and I'm leaving. About how the whole town's probably noticed us spending time together and has opinions about it.

But I also think about Harper's honesty, her bravery in admitting her own fear, the fact that she's willing to risk getting hurt to see what might happen between us.

And I think that maybe—just maybe—being scared doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

"Harper?"

"Yeah?"

"These last eight weeks... can we just see what happens? No promises, no plans, just... see?"

She's quiet for a moment. Then: "Yeah. We can do that."

We swing gently, hands still linked, fireflies dancing around us. It's not a commitment. It's not a promise I'll stay. But it's permission to stop fighting what's happening between us and just let it unfold.

It's terrifying.

It's also the bravest thing I've ever done.

Walking Harper home that night, our hands still linked, I realize something fundamental has shifted. I'm not just passing through Silver Ridge anymore. I'm here—really here, present and engaged and feeling things I've spent two years running from.

I might still leave in eight weeks.

But I'm not leaving tonight.

And for now, that's enough.
