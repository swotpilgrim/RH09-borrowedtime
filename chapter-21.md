# Chapter 21: Crisis - The Fight

Harper caught me as I was leaving the community center.

"We need to talk."

The afternoon session had just ended—four days before the festival. Harper stood in the doorway, arms crossed, expression set in a way I'd never seen before.

Not hurt. Not distant.

Angry.

"Okay," I said carefully.

"Outside." She walked past me toward the parking lot, and I followed, my stomach knotting.

August heat hit us as we stepped outside. Harper walked to the far corner of the lot, away from anyone who might overhear. When she turned to face me, her eyes were bright with barely contained emotion.

"I'm done," she said.

"Done with what?"

"This. Whatever this is." She gestured between us. "I'm done trying to figure out what you want. Done pretending this doesn't hurt."

"Harper—"

"No." Her voice was sharp. "You don't get to 'Harper' me and make this go away. You've been avoiding me for weeks. Acting like I'm some kind of problem you're trying to manage instead of a person you supposedly care about."

"I do care about you—"

"Then act like it!" The words burst out loud enough that I flinched. "Stop treating me like borrowed time! Stop acting like leaving just *happens* to you when it's a choice you make every day."

"It's not that simple."

"Why not?" Harper's eyes flashed. "You've got a job offer. You've got people who care about you. You've got me. So why is leaving the only option you can see?"

"Because I don't know how to stay!" The admission tore out of me. "I don't know how to be what you need me to be."

"I need you to be honest. I need you to be brave. I don't need you to be perfect." Her voice cracked slightly. "But you keep hiding behind excuses—you're protecting me, you're being realistic, you're not built for permanence. Those are just pretty ways of saying you're scared."

"Of course I'm scared! I'm terrified!"

"Of what? Of me? Of this town? Of actually being happy?"

"Of hurting you worse than leaving now would!" I ran my hands through my hair. "If I stay and fail at it, if I wake up six months from now needing the road again, I'll destroy you. At least if I leave now, the hurt is clean."

Harper's laugh was bitter. "Clean? You think this is clean?" She wiped at her eyes angrily. "You've been pulling away for weeks. You've already been leaving, Jesse. You're just doing it slow enough to convince yourself it's kind."

The accusation hit like a slap because it was true.

"I was trying to protect you—"

"Stop saying that!" Harper's composure cracked, tears spilling over. "You're not protecting me. You're protecting yourself. You're doing to me exactly what your stepfather did to you—making me feel unwanted, like I'm not worth the risk of staying."

The comparison struck deep. "That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" She stepped closer, and I could see the hurt swimming in her eyes. "Your stepfather rejected you, made you feel disposable. And now you're rejecting me first, making yourself disposable, because that way *you* control when the rejection happens. You'd rather hurt me on your terms than risk me possibly hurting you later."

"I'm trying to save us both from worse pain—"

"There is no us to save!" Harper's voice broke. "There can't be an us when you won't even try. When you've already decided it's doomed before giving it a chance."

I stared at her, words failing me. Everything she was saying was true.

"I love you," Harper said, and the words made my chest ache. "I've been in love with you since July. I tried so hard not to be. But I fell anyway because you're kind and funny and you see me—really see me, not just the minister's daughter everyone expects me to be."

She wiped at her tears, but they kept coming. "I fell in love with you, and you fell for me too. I know you did. I saw it. You loved me back."

"I did. I do." The admission came out hoarse. "Harper, I love you so much it scares me."

"Then stay." Her voice was pleading now. "Stay and be scared with me. Stay and we'll figure it out together. Stay because even if it's hard and even if you're terrified, at least we'll have tried."

I wanted to say yes. God, I wanted to promise her everything. But the fear was a living thing in my chest, choking me.

"What if I can't?" I whispered. "What if I try and fail? What if I hurt you anyway?"

"Then you hurt me." Fresh tears tracked down her cheeks. "But at least I'll know you tried. At least I'll know you wanted me enough to risk failing. Right now, you're choosing guaranteed heartbreak over possible happiness, and I can't understand that."

"I'm choosing guaranteed heartbreak for me, not for you—"

"You're choosing it for both of us!" Her voice rose again. "You think leaving doesn't break my heart? You think I'm going to be fine just because you left to 'protect' me? I'm already broken, Jesse. You already hurt me. You're still hurting me right now."

The words were like knives. I'd spent weeks trying to prevent exactly this pain, and I'd caused it anyway. Worse, I'd drawn it out, made her suffer through my indecision and fear.

"I'm sorry," I said uselessly.

"I don't want you to be sorry." Harper's hands clenched into fists at her sides. "I want you to be brave. I want you to choose me. I want you to risk your stupid heart on the possibility that maybe, just maybe, you could be happy here."

"Harper—"

"Do you love me?"

The question stopped me cold. "Yes."

"Do you want to stay?"

"Yes, but—"

"Then stay!" She threw her hands up. "Stop making it complicated. Stop hiding behind what-ifs and fears. Just stay because you love me and I love you and that should be enough."

"What if it's not?" The fear clawed its way out. "What if love isn't enough to change who I am?"

"Who you are?" Harper stared at me. "You keep saying that like you're fundamentally broken. But it's not who you are, Jesse. It's what you've done. It's a habit, a choice you've been making over and over. But you can make a different choice."

"I don't know how."

"You start by deciding to try!" She was crying openly now. "You start by saying yes instead of maybe. You start by being as brave as you're asking me to be."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm being brave right now." Her voice shook. "I'm standing here telling you I love you even though you're probably going to leave anyway. I'm risking my heart on someone who won't risk his. I'm fighting for us even though you've given up. So don't tell me you can't be brave. You're just choosing not to be."

The accusation hung between us, true and terrible.

"I can't fight your fear for you," Harper said, exhaustion creeping into her voice. "I can't make you believe you're worth staying for. I can't convince you that we're worth trying for. Only you can decide that. And it kills me that you're choosing fear over me."

"I'm trying to choose what's best—"

"For who?" She cut me off. "Not for me. I've told you what I want. Not for you—you're miserable with this choice. You're choosing what's safest, not what's best. And safe isn't the same as good."

I stood there, gutted by her words, unable to argue because everything she said was true.

"I love you," Harper said again, softer now. "But I can't keep doing this. I can't keep hoping you'll choose me while you keep choosing fear. I can't fight for us by myself. It has to be both of us, and right now it's just me. I can't... I can't do it anymore."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying I'm done." She wiped her face with the back of her hand. "If you're leaving, then leave. Make it clean instead of this slow torture. And if you're staying, then tell me right now that you're staying, that you're choosing this, that you're all in. But I can't live in this awful in-between where you won't commit and won't let go."

The ultimatum was fair. Kinder than I deserved, actually.

"I..." The word stuck in my throat. I wanted to say I was staying. Wanted to promise her everything. But the fear wouldn't let the words form.

Harper saw my paralysis and her face crumpled. "You can't even say it."

"I'm trying—"

"No, you're not." Her voice was devastated. "You're thinking. You're calculating. You're running through all the ways it could go wrong. But you're not trying to stay. You're trying to justify leaving."

She wasn't wrong.

"I love you," she said one more time. "But I can't make you love me enough to stay. I can't be brave for both of us. You have to choose this. And if you can't..." She trailed off, unable to finish.

She didn't have to. I understood.

"Harper, please—"

"Don't." She stepped back. "Don't make this harder. Don't make promises you can't keep. Just... decide. Stay or go. Love me or leave me. But stop this middle ground that's killing us both."

"I need time—"

"You've had all summer." Her voice was flat now, empty. "The festival's in four days. Your departure date is in five. If you haven't decided by now, then you have decided. You're just too scared to admit it."

She turned and walked toward her car.

"Harper, wait—"

But she didn't wait. She got in her car, started the engine, and drove away, leaving me standing alone in the parking lot with the August sun beating down and my heart in pieces at my feet.

She loved me.

She'd fought for us.

And I'd stood there paralyzed, unable to give her the one thing she needed: a choice. A commitment. The promise that I was staying.

I sank onto the curb, head in my hands, her words replaying on loop.

*You're choosing fear over me.*

*I can't fight for us by myself.*

*But I can't make you love me enough to stay.*

The worst part was she was right. About all of it. I'd been doing to her what had been done to me. I'd been choosing safety over love. I'd been letting fear drive while calling it protection.

And now I'd lost her.

Unless I could find the courage to choose differently.

Four days until the festival. Five days until my departure date.

Four days to decide if I was brave enough to stay.
