# Chapter 20: August Arrival

The third week of August came in hot and relentless.

I stood in Frank's driveway early one morning, hood of my Chevy truck open, checking the engine. The repairs I'd done over the summer had taken. She ran better than she had in months—smooth and reliable, ready to carry me anywhere I wanted to go.

The irony wasn't lost on me.

I'd fixed my escape vehicle just in time to not know if I wanted to escape.

"She's running good," Frank observed, coming out with two mugs of coffee. He handed me one and peered at the engine. "You did quality work on her."

"Thanks." I closed the hood, accepting the coffee. "Been needing these repairs for a while."

"You planning to use her soon?"

The question hung between us. Frank knew my original timeline—Labor Day weekend, out of Silver Ridge before September arrived. That was nine days away now. Just over a week.

"Don't know yet," I admitted.

Frank nodded, sipping his coffee. "Well, she's ready when you decide."

We stood there in the morning quiet, steam rising from our mugs. Down the street, a neighbor's dog barked. A car drove past, probably heading to the early shift at one of the town's few factories.

Silver Ridge waking up, same as it did every morning.

"Got some news," Frank said finally. "Jensen Construction—they're the big outfit two towns over—they're planning expansion projects for fall and winter. Highway work, new buildings going up. They need good workers."

"That's good for the area."

"They're hiring locally where they can. I mentioned you might be interested." Frank's tone was casual, but his eyes were watchful. "Permanent position. Good pay. Benefits. Year-round work, not just seasonal."

My chest tightened. "Frank—"

"Just passing along information," he said mildly. "No pressure. But if you were thinking about staying, there's opportunity here. Real opportunity, not just summer work."

He drained his coffee and headed back inside, leaving me standing in the driveway with the morning sun warming my face and my mind spinning.

A permanent job. The practical obstacle I'd been hiding behind—no work available, can't support myself, what would I even do—Frank had just removed it.

He'd offered me a way to stay.

If I was brave enough to take it.

I finished my coffee and drove to the construction site, Frank's words echoing in my head. The day was long and hot, my hands busy with familiar work while my thoughts churned uselessly.

Danny showed up around lunchtime with sandwiches from the diner.

"Carol Ann made these," he said, tossing me one. "She's been in a mood all morning."

"About what?"

"About Harper." Danny sat beside me in the shade, unwrapping his sandwich. "Apparently Harper came over last night in tears. Again."

The guilt that had become my constant companion twisted sharper.

"She say what about?"

"You really have to ask?" Danny's expression was tired. "She's in love with a guy who's leaving in a week. Pretty sure that's tear-worthy."

I stared at my sandwich, appetite gone. "I never meant—"

"Yeah, I know. You never meant to hurt her." Danny's voice wasn't unkind, just resigned. "But intention doesn't change result. She's hurting. You're hurting. And you've got just over a week to figure out what you're gonna do about it."

"Frank mentioned there's permanent work available."

"I know. He told me." Danny looked at me directly. "So what's stopping you?"

"What if I take the job, stay for Harper, and six months from now I wake up needing the road again? What if I'm just built wrong for this?"

"What if you're not?"

The simple question shouldn't have been so devastating.

"I've got two years of proof I can't stay put," I said.

"You've got two years of proof you didn't have a reason to stay put," Danny corrected. "Now you do. Harper's a reason. This town's a reason. The life you could build here is a reason. Question is whether you're gonna let fear stop you from even trying."

He finished his sandwich and stood, brushing crumbs off his pants. "For what it's worth, I think you'd be good here. I think you'd be happy. But I can't make you believe that." He clapped my shoulder. "Only you can."

The afternoon dragged. Every hammer blow, every measurement, every mundane task felt weighted with the decision pressing down on me. Nine days. Just over a week. Then Labor Day weekend and the choice I'd been avoiding all summer would make itself.

Unless I made it first.

That evening I went to the community center. I told myself it was obligation—Frank still expected me to volunteer. But really, I needed to see Harper. Needed to know if Danny was right about the crying, about how badly I was hurting her.

She was there, of course, organizing festival preparations with characteristic efficiency. The youth center booth was taking shape—kids' artwork displayed on boards, paper lanterns strung on twine, handmade crafts arranged on tables.

Harper moved through it all with focused energy, directing kids and volunteers, making decisions about placement and decoration. She wore a simple blue dress and had pulled her hair back, a few strands escaping to frame her face.

She looked beautiful.

She looked exhausted.

And when she smiled at the kids, it didn't reach her eyes the way it used to.

I'd done that. My fear, my inability to decide, my careful distance—I'd stolen the light from her smile.

"Jesse!" One of the boys called out. "Come see what we made!"

I crossed to their table, let them show me their painted signs with the enthusiasm only kids could muster. Harper was ten feet away, talking to another volunteer, carefully not looking in my direction.

The session passed in that terrible polite distance we'd perfected. Harper was professional, courteous, completely closed off. With everyone else she was warm. With me, she was civil.

It was worse than anger would have been.

When the kids left and we cleaned up, I tried to help but Harper had already assigned tasks to other volunteers. There was nothing for me to do except feel useless and unwanted—which was fitting, since that's exactly what I'd made her feel.

"Harper—" I started as she walked past with an armload of supplies.

"Can't talk now, busy," she said without slowing down.

I watched her disappear into the storage closet and stood there like an idiot, paralyzed by my own making.

Outside, the August evening was still warm, the sun sinking toward the mountains. I sat in my truck and stared at the community center building, lit from within by golden light.

Nine days until my original departure date.

My truck was ready. My savings account was healthier than it had been in two years. I had no ties, no obligations beyond finishing out the week with Frank. I could leave tomorrow if I wanted. Roll out of Silver Ridge and point my truck toward anywhere that wasn't here.

Except I didn't want to go anywhere. I wanted to stay here. In this small mountain town where everyone knew everyone's business and the opportunities were limited but the people were genuine. Where Frank had given me honest work and Danny had given me real friendship. Where kids at the community center had learned to trust me.

Where Harper had loved me before I pushed her away.

I thought about Frank's job offer. Permanent work. A real income. The foundation for building an actual life instead of just passing through.

I thought about the Reverend's words: *Knowing your past doesn't mean accepting it as your future.*

I thought about Danny's question: *What if you're not built wrong? What if you just never had a reason to stay?*

The truck seat beneath me was familiar—worn leather that had been home for two years. I'd slept in this truck, eaten in it, cried in it when the loneliness got too heavy. It represented freedom. Safety. The ability to leave whenever staying got too hard.

But lately it had started to feel like a cage.

A car pulled into the parking lot—Carol Ann's powder-blue Bel Air. She parked next to me and rolled down her window.

"Sitting out here looking pathetic isn't going to fix anything," she said without preamble.

"Wasn't trying to fix anything."

"Well, you're definitely not fixing anything, so at least you're succeeding at something." Carol Ann's expression was hard. "Harper just about cried herself sick last night. You know that?"

The guilt knife twisted again. "Danny mentioned."

"She loves you, Jesse. Really loves you. Not summer crush loves you—actually, genuinely, scared-to-lose-you loves you." Carol Ann's eyes were fierce. "And you're going to break her heart because you're too scared to risk yours."

"It's not that simple—"

"It really is, though." She leaned toward her window. "You're scared. I get it. Your stepdad treated you like garbage, and now you think everyone will eventually do the same. But Harper's not your stepdad. This town isn't your stepdad. And you're not that hurt kid anymore—you're a grown man who gets to choose what happens next."

"What if I choose wrong?"

"What if you do?" Carol Ann shrugged. "What if you stay and it doesn't work out? At least you tried. At least you were brave enough to reach for something you wanted. That's better than spending the rest of your life wondering what would've happened if you'd just had the guts to stay."

She rolled up her window and drove away, leaving me sitting in the parking lot with the evening darkening around me.

Nine days.

I could spend them preparing to leave—mentally packing, emotionally detaching, counting down until the moment I could escape this impossible choice.

Or I could spend them making a different choice. Accepting Frank's job offer. Finding my own place to rent. Apologizing to Harper and asking if maybe, possibly, there was still a chance for us.

The thought terrified me.

The thought of leaving terrified me more.

I started the truck—engine running smooth and reliable, ready for whatever I decided. I sat there listening to it idle, one hand on the steering wheel.

Frank's house was east. The highway out of town was west.

Nine days to decide which direction I'd point this truck when the time came.

I put it in reverse and headed back to Frank's house, choosing neither direction yet.

But I couldn't avoid choosing forever.

Time was running out, and my paralysis was just another way of choosing to run.

The question was whether I'd realize that before it was too late.
