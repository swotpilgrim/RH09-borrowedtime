# Chapter 23: The Festival

I wasn't going to go to the festival.

My plan: stay at Frank's house, finish packing, leave before dawn. No goodbyes. Clean and quick.

But Frank had other plans.

"Get dressed," he said that evening, standing in my doorway. The sun was setting, and I was sitting on the bed staring at my packed duffel bag.

"I'm not going."

"Yes, you are."

"Frank—"

"Don't be a coward twice in one week." His voice was firm. "You're leaving. Fine. But you're going to say goodbye properly. You're going to show your face and acknowledge what you're walking away from."

"I don't think that's a good idea."

"I don't care what you think is a good idea." Frank crossed his arms. "Those kids at the community center, they worked all summer on that booth. Danny's going to be there. Harper's going to be there. You owe them the courtesy of showing up, even if you're planning to disappear tomorrow."

The guilt was heavy and deserved. "Harper doesn't want to see me."

"Maybe not. But she deserves the chance to decide that for herself instead of you making the decision for her." Frank turned to leave. "Get dressed. I'm leaving in ten minutes. You can ride with me or walk, but you're going."

He closed the door, and I sat there knowing he was right. Running without saying goodbye, slipping away in the predawn darkness—that was the act of a coward. And I'd been called a coward enough this week to recognize the truth of it.

I changed into clean jeans and the nicest shirt I owned, ran a hand through my hair, and followed Frank to his truck.

The drive to the town center was silent.

The festival was already in full swing. String lights hung between buildings, creating a canopy of warm light. A local band played rockabilly music. Tables lined the street selling food and crafts. Kids ran between the booths.

Silver Ridge celebrating summer's end.

Frank headed toward the construction crew, leaving me alone on the edge of the crowd. I stayed in the shadows, hands in my pockets.

An outsider observing, not participating.

Same as always.

Then I saw her.

Harper stood at the youth center booth. She wore a blue dress—simple, cotton, perfect. Hair down, falling in soft waves. Laughing at something one of the little girls had said, her whole face lit with genuine joy.

Beautiful.

Happy.

And I was going to walk away from her tomorrow because I was too scared to stay.

I watched as Harper helped the kids show off their summer projects. Painted signs hung on display. Paper lanterns swayed. Friendship bracelets lined up on a table.

Everything Harper had been working on all summer, brought to life.

A little girl—Sarah, the one who'd asked if I was taking Harper to the festival—tugged on Harper's skirt, showing her something she'd made. Harper crouched down to Sarah's level, giving the child her full attention. She examined whatever Sarah was showing her with exaggerated admiration, then pulled Sarah into a quick hug that made the little girl beam.

My chest ached watching them.

Tommy, one of the boys from the basketball court, ran up waving a ribbon he'd won at one of the game booths. Harper high-fived him, celebrating his victory like it was the most important thing in the world. Tommy's grin could have lit up the whole festival.

Harper had this gift—this ability to make everyone feel seen, valued, important. She gave her warmth freely, without calculation or reservation. She loved these kids, loved this community, belonged here in a way I never had.

And she'd tried to give that same warmth to me.

I'd thrown it back in her face because I was terrified of losing it.

Carol Ann appeared at Harper's side, saying something that made Harper laugh. A real laugh, not the careful polite version I'd been getting for weeks. Carol Ann handed Harper a lemonade, and they stood together watching the kids, best friends comfortable in each other's silence.

Harper belonged here. In this town, with these people, doing this work. She'd probably marry someone local eventually—someone who wasn't scared of commitment, someone who knew how to stay. She'd keep running the youth center programs, keep making kids feel special, keep being the warmhearted girl everyone loved.

She'd be fine without me.

The thought should have been comforting.

It made me want to throw up.

Because the truth I'd been avoiding crashed over me in that moment, watching Harper smile in her blue dress under festival lights: I didn't want her to be fine without me. I didn't want her to marry someone else, build a life with someone else, be happy with someone else.

I wanted to be the one who made her laugh.

I wanted to be the one she turned to with that warm smile.

I wanted to be the person who got to stand beside her at next year's festival, and the year after that, and every year until the festivals blurred together into a lifetime of shared moments.

I didn't want to leave Silver Ridge.

I didn't want to get in my truck tomorrow and drive away from these mountains, this town, Frank's quiet wisdom and Danny's loyal friendship and the community center kids who'd learned to trust me.

I didn't want to go back to anonymous motels and temporary jobs and the loneliness of always being the outsider looking in.

I wanted to stay.

The realization hit me so hard I had to lean against the brick building behind me for support. My hands were shaking. My chest felt too tight, like I couldn't get enough air.

I wanted to stay.

Not because I should. Not out of obligation or guilt or because everyone was telling me to. But because when I imagined my future, the only version that didn't feel empty was the one where I was here. In Silver Ridge. With Harper.

I'd spent weeks focused on the fear of eventually leaving, calculating all the ways staying could go wrong, protecting myself from potential future pain.

But I hadn't let myself feel this: the overwhelming, terrifying, undeniable truth that I wanted to stay. That the thought of leaving felt like tearing myself in half.

I'd been asking the wrong question all summer.

The question wasn't whether I could stay forever, whether I could promise Harper a perfect future with no possibility of failure.

The question was what I wanted right now. Today. Tomorrow. Next month.

And what I wanted—more than safety, more than the freedom of the road, more than the protection of keeping my heart locked away—was her.

I wanted Harper.

I wanted Sunday dinners with her family and festival lights and inside jokes and her hand in mine. I wanted to wake up in the same town for more than a few months, build something real instead of something temporary, choose roots over running.

I wanted to try.

Even if I was terrified. Even if I might fail. Even if every instinct I'd developed over two years of drifting was screaming at me to get back in my truck and drive.

I wanted to choose bravery over fear.

I wanted to choose her.

The festival continued around me—music playing, people laughing, children running past with ribbons and cotton candy. But I stood frozen against the brick wall, hands shaking, heart racing, as everything I thought I knew about myself rearranged into a new truth.

I wasn't someone who left.

I was someone who'd been leaving because I never had a reason to stay.

But now I did.

Harper moved through the crowd, helping a mother carry her child's artwork to her car. Her dress swayed as she walked, the festival lights catching in her hair. She was graceful and kind and so beautiful it hurt to look at her.

And she'd told me she loved me.

She'd fought for us even when I'd given up. She'd been brave enough to risk her heart on someone who was planning to leave. She'd asked me to stay, to try, to choose her.

And I'd stood there paralyzed, too scared to say yes.

But I wasn't paralyzed anymore.

The fear was still there—huge and overwhelming, telling me all the ways this could go wrong. But for the first time all summer, the desire to stay was bigger than the fear of trying.

I pushed off the wall, my legs unsteady, and started walking toward the youth center booth.

Toward Harper.

I didn't have a speech prepared. Didn't have the perfect words to undo weeks of hurt and distance. Didn't have guarantees or promises or certainty about the future.

I just had the truth: I loved her, I wanted to stay, and I was finally brave enough to say it out loud.

The crowd seemed to part as I walked through, or maybe that was just my imagination. Danny saw me first, his eyes widening in surprise. Carol Ann noticed next, nudging Harper and nodding in my direction.

Harper turned.

Our eyes met across the festival grounds, and everything else fell away. The music, the crowd, the lights—it all faded to background noise.

Just Harper, in her blue dress, looking at me with careful neutrality masking the hurt I'd put in her eyes.

I kept walking toward her, my heart hammering against my ribs.

She didn't move. Didn't smile. Didn't encourage me or make this easier.

She just stood there waiting to see what I would do.

Fair enough. I'd spent weeks failing her. The least I could do was find the courage to walk across a festival and tell her I was sorry.

Tell her I loved her.

Tell her I was staying.

If she'd still have me.

I stopped a few feet away, suddenly uncertain. What if I was too late? What if she'd meant what she said—that she was done, that she couldn't keep fighting for us alone?

"Jesse." My name on her lips, neutral and guarded.

"Harper." My voice was rough. "Can we talk?"

She glanced at the youth center booth, the kids still milling around, then back at me. "I'm working."

"Please." The word came out desperate. "Just a few minutes. I need to tell you something."

Something flickered in her expression—hope, maybe, or maybe just curiosity. "Okay."

She said something to Carol Ann, who nodded and took over at the booth. Harper walked past me, not toward the crowds but away from them, toward the quieter edge of the festival.

I followed, my whole future balanced on what happened in the next few minutes.

This was it.

The moment I either found the courage to choose her.

Or lost her forever because I'd waited too long to be brave.
