# Chapter 9: The Overlook

Harper and I drive to the overlook one evening after the community center closes. It's become our place somehow—this rocky outcrop above town where you can see everything and nothing feels too close.

We sit on the truck bed, legs dangling, watching the sun paint the sky pink and gold. The June evening is warm but cooling, mountain air carrying the scent of pine and wildflowers. Below us, Silver Ridge settles into evening—lights coming on in windows, smoke rising from chimneys as families make dinner.

"This never gets old," Harper says, leaning back on her hands. "I've watched probably a thousand sunsets from up here and every one's different."

"How'd you find this spot?"

"My dad brought me when I was eight. I was upset about something—probably some friend drama at school—and he drove me up here. Told me that when problems feel too big, sometimes you need to get above them and see the whole picture." She smiles at the memory. "It became our thing for a while. Whenever I was upset, we'd drive up here."

"What changed?"

"I got older. He got busier. And I could drive myself." She glances at me. "But I still come up here when Silver Ridge feels too small."

We sit in comfortable silence, watching the colors shift. I've learned Harper doesn't need every silence filled, doesn't push for conversation when quiet feels right. It's one of the things that makes being around her easy.

"Can I ask you something?" Harper's voice is quiet.

"Sure."

"What are you running from?"

The question catches me off guard, though maybe it shouldn't. Harper's been circling around this for weeks, asking about my travels, my past, why I keep moving. Now she's asking directly.

"What makes you think I'm running from something?"

"Because you talk about traveling like it's something you have to do, not something you want to do." She turns to look at me. "The way you left California at sixteen. How you never stay anywhere longer than three months. How you won't even consider the possibility of settling down." She pauses. "That's not adventure. That's escape."

Nobody's ever said it that plainly. Most people accept my story about liking to travel, seeing new places. Harper sees through it.

"My stepfather didn't want me around," I say finally. "Made that clear enough times that I left before he could actually throw me out."

"That's awful. I'm sorry."

"It was two years ago. I'm over it."

"Are you?" She's not challenging me, just genuinely asking. "Because it seems like you're still letting him decide where you go and how long you stay."

The observation hits harder than I expect. I've spent two years thinking I was choosing freedom, choosing independence. Harper's suggesting I'm still reacting to being unwanted, still running from rejection instead of toward anything real.

"I never thought about it like that."

"Maybe you should." Harper picks up a pebble, tosses it over the edge. We listen to it clatter down the rocks. "My mom says the opposite of love isn't hate—it's indifference. If you're still reacting to what your stepfather did, you're still letting him control you."

"So what, I should just forget about it?"

"No. But maybe stop letting it define every choice you make." She looks at me seriously. "You could stay somewhere, Jesse. Build something. But you won't let yourself try."

"Because what if I try and fail? What if I stay somewhere and they decide they don't want me after all?"

"Then you'll have tried. And you'll know." She shifts closer. "But if you never try, you'll never know if you could have succeeded. You're guaranteeing the outcome you're afraid of by running before anyone has a chance to reject you."

The truth of it settles over me like weight. That's exactly what I've been doing—leaving before being left, rejecting before being rejected. I've called it freedom but it's just fear.

"What about you?" I ask, deflecting. "What are you running from?"

"I'm not running. I'm stuck." Harper looks out at the mountains ringing the valley. "My parents want me to stay, the town expects me to stay, and part of me wants to stay because I love Silver Ridge and the people here. But another part wants to leave so badly I can barely stand it sometimes."

"So leave."

"It's not that simple."

"Why not? You're seventeen. Almost eighteen. You can go anywhere you want."

"And abandon my family? Disappoint everyone who's counting on me?" She shakes her head. "You don't understand what it's like growing up here. Everyone knows you. Everyone has expectations. The minister's daughter doesn't just take off to see the world."

"The minister's daughter is also a person with her own dreams."

"I know that. But knowing it and acting on it are different." She pulls her knees up, wrapping her arms around them. "Sometimes I think about what would happen if I just drove to California one weekend. Didn't tell anyone, just went. But then I imagine my parents worrying, the town talking, everyone disappointed. And I can't do it."

We're quiet for a moment. Then Harper laughs, soft and sad.

"We're quite a pair, aren't we? You won't stop running and I can't start."

"Maybe we balance each other out."

"Or maybe we're both trapped in different ways."

The sun's lower now, the sky deepening to purple and orange. Stars are starting to appear—just the brightest ones at first, but more every minute. The first evening star hangs low over the western mountains.

"I like being up here with you," Harper says quietly.

"Me too."

"But you're still leaving in September."

It's not a question, but I answer anyway. "That's the plan."

"Plans can change."

"Harper—"

"I know. You don't stay places. You've told me." She looks at me, and there's something vulnerable in her expression. "But what if this place was different? What if you wanted to stay?"

"I don't know how."

"You could learn. People learn new things all the time."

"What if I try and fail? What if I stay for a while and then need to leave anyway?"

"Then you leave. But at least you tried." She reaches over, touches my hand briefly. "At least you'd know."

Her hand is warm on mine, and I'm very aware of how close we're sitting, how the fading light catches in her hair, how her eyes look almost gold in the sunset.

I should pull away. Should remind her I'm leaving, that getting attached is a mistake. Should put distance between us before this goes any further than late evening conversations on a mountain.

But I don't want to pull away.

"Jesse?" Harper's voice is barely above a whisper.

"Yeah?"

"What are you really afraid of?"

I think about the question honestly. "That I'll stay and you'll realize I'm not worth staying for. That I'll prove my stepfather right—that I'm not someone people want to keep around."

"That's not who you are."

"You don't know that."

"I do know that." She says it with complete certainty. "I've spent weeks with you. I've watched you with the kids at the center, seen how you help without being asked, listened to you talk about the places you've been. You're not someone who's not worth keeping. You're someone who's been taught to believe that."

The distinction hits me hard. All this time I've thought the problem was me—that there was something fundamentally unlovable or unwanted about me. Harper's suggesting the problem is what I was taught to believe, not who I actually am.

"I don't know how to believe anything different."

"Then start small. Start by believing I see something good in you. Can you believe that?"

I look at her—this girl who's been nothing but honest with me, who asks real questions and listens to real answers, who somehow sees past the walls I've built and likes what she finds underneath.

"Yeah," I say quietly. "I can believe that."

Harper smiles, and it transforms her face. "That's a start."

We sit there as full dark falls, stars multiplying overhead until the sky is full of them. The lights of Silver Ridge twinkle below like fallen stars. It's beautiful and peaceful and I don't want it to end.

But eventually Harper checks her watch. "I should get home. My parents will worry."

We climb down from the truck bed and I drive us back down the mountain. The road is dark and winding, my headlights cutting through the night. Harper's quiet beside me, and I wonder what she's thinking.

At her house, she pauses before getting out.

"Thank you for tonight. For listening. For being honest."

"Thank you for seeing me. The real me, I mean."

"That's the only version I've ever seen." She smiles. "Night, Jesse."

"Night."

I watch her walk to her door, turn and wave before going inside. Then I drive back to Frank's house, replaying the conversation.

Harper asked what I'm running from, and I finally admitted the truth: fear. Fear of being unwanted, fear of failing, fear of trying and proving everyone who didn't want me was right.

But she also gave me something I didn't expect—the possibility that I'm not fundamentally unlovable. That the problem isn't me, but what I was taught to believe about myself.

It's a small thing, that shift in perspective. But it feels seismic.

I lie in Frank's spare room that night, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Harper's question: what if you wanted to stay?

For the first time, I let myself actually consider it. What if I stayed in Silver Ridge past September? What if I took Frank up on his offer of permanent work? What if I stopped running and started building?

The thought still terrifies me.

But it also feels possible in a way it never has before.

And that might be the most terrifying thing of all.
