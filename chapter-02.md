# Chapter 2: The Uncle's Rules

Sunday morning Frank wakes me at eight-thirty with a knock on the door and the words, "Church is at ten. Wear something decent."

I own one decent shirt—a white button-down I keep pressed between my jeans in the duffel bag for job interviews or occasions exactly like this. I pair it with my less-worn jeans and the work boots I cleaned last night. Not Sunday best by most standards, but it's what I've got.

Frank's waiting in the kitchen wearing dark slacks and a pressed shirt, his gray hair combed back with pomade. He looks me over briefly, nods once, and hands me a cup of coffee.

"Community center's walking distance," he says. "We'll head over at quarter till."

I drink the coffee standing at the counter, looking out the window at a perfect June morning. Clear sky, mountains sharp against the blue. Somewhere down the street a church bell rings, calling the faithful.

"I'm not much for church," I say, because it seems like something Frank should know.

"Neither am I, particularly." He rinses his mug in the sink, sets it in the dish rack. "But I made a promise to my brother before he died that I'd look after his boy if the need ever came up. Part of looking after you means making sure you're part of something while you're here. Community. Structure. Church provides that."

My father. He's talking about my father, who died when I was six. I barely remember him—just impressions of a tall man who smelled like cigarettes and Old Spice, who taught me how to tie my shoes and died in a factory accident before I started first grade.

"You don't have to believe," Frank continues. "Just have to show up and be respectful. Can you do that?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good." He checks his watch. "Let's go."

The walk to the community center takes maybe ten minutes. Families in their Sunday clothes head the same direction, kids scrubbed and squirming in stiff collars. Several people nod at Frank as we pass. A few glance at me with curiosity.

The community center is a two-story brick building that looks like it might've been a school once. Wide steps lead up to double doors propped open, and I can hear organ music drifting out. The lawn around it is tidy, bordered by flower beds someone tends with care.

Inside, the main room has been set up as a chapel—rows of folding chairs facing a simple wooden altar, windows open to let in the June breeze. It's already mostly full, and Frank leads me to seats near the back. Better for leaving quickly after, I figure.

I've been to enough different churches in the last two years to know the routine. Stand for hymns, sit for prayers, stand for scripture. The organ wheezes along and people sing with varying degrees of enthusiasm.

Reverend Wells stands at the altar in his minister's robes, a tall man with graying hair and a kind face. I don't pay much attention to the sermon—something about stewardship and community. Instead I watch the congregation.

There's a clear social order in the seating. Prominent families up front, working folks like us toward the back, young families with small children in the very last rows. Everyone dressed in their best, everyone playing their part.

I spot her during the second hymn.

She's sitting three rows ahead on the opposite side, standing with a hymnal open, singing. Dark hair curled and pinned neatly, a yellow dress with short sleeves, white gloves holding the songbook. I can't see her face from this angle, just her profile, but something about the way she holds herself—easy and natural, not stiff like some of the others—catches my attention.

When everyone sits for the next prayer, I make myself stop looking at her and focus on the back of the chair in front of me.

The service ends with a final hymn and a benediction. People gather in small groups, talking and laughing. Frank stands and gestures for me to follow.

"Come on. I'll introduce you to the Reverend."

We make our way through the crowd. People say hello to Frank, nod at me. I'm conscious of being assessed—the stranger staying with Frank Carter. I keep my expression neutral and pleasant.

Reverend Wells is shaking hands near the altar, speaking with an elderly couple. When he sees Frank, he smiles and excuses himself.

"Frank, good to see you." His handshake is firm, his eyes sharp despite the kindness in them. He looks at me with interest. "And this must be your nephew."

"Jesse Carter," Frank says. "Jesse, this is Reverend Thomas Wells. He runs the community center and the youth programs."

"Welcome to Silver Ridge, Jesse." The Reverend's grip is strong. "Frank mentioned you'd be staying the summer."

"Yes, sir. Thank you for having me this morning."

"Our pleasure. Frank tells me you'll be helping with our youth programs a couple afternoons a week?"

I glance at Frank, who's watching me with that steady expression that expects agreement.

"Yes, sir. Happy to help however I can."

"Wonderful. We run programs for the kids most weekday afternoons—sports, crafts, tutoring, that sort of thing. Keeps them busy and out of trouble during summer vacation. My daughter Harper coordinates most of it. Let me introduce you."

He turns and calls across the room. "Harper, honey, come here a moment."

The girl in the yellow dress turns from the group she's talking with and makes her way over. Up close I can see she's maybe seventeen, pretty in that wholesome way girls from good families are pretty, with warm brown eyes and a smile that looks genuine rather than polite.

"Harper, this is Jesse Carter, Frank's nephew. He'll be helping with the youth programs this summer. Jesse, my daughter Harper."

She extends her hand and I shake it, conscious of the white glove between our skin.

"Nice to meet you, Jesse. Welcome to Silver Ridge."

"Thank you."

"Where are you from originally?" Her voice is friendly, curious without being invasive.

"Different places. I've been moving around the last couple years."

"That must be interesting." There's genuine interest in her eyes, not judgment. "We're glad to have you here for the summer. Are you good with kids?"

"I'm not bad with them, I guess."

She smiles. "That's more honest than most people. Not bad is a good starting point."

I find myself almost smiling back. There's something about her manner—warm but not pushy, friendly without being false—that catches me off guard.

"Harper's been running our summer programs for three years now," Reverend Wells says with obvious pride. "She's wonderful with the children."

"Dad." Harper's tone is affectionate but embarrassed. "Don't scare him off his first day."

"I'm just stating facts." The Reverend chuckles, then glances at someone beckoning him from across the room. "Excuse me, I'm needed. Harper, why don't you tell Jesse about the schedule?"

He moves away into the crowd, and Harper turns back to me with an apologetic smile.

"He means well. Parents always oversell things." She shifts her weight slightly, comfortable in her heels in a way that suggests she wears them often. "The programs run Monday through Friday, two to five. We usually have fifteen to twenty kids on any given day, ages six to fourteen. Mondays and Wednesdays are sports and outdoor games. Tuesdays and Thursdays are crafts and music. Fridays we do tutoring for anyone who needs help with schoolwork."

"Sounds organized."

"It helps to have structure. Otherwise it's just chaos." She pauses, studying me with those brown eyes that seem to see more than I'd prefer. "Frank mentioned you've been traveling. Do you like it?"

The question surprises me. Most people ask where I've been or where I'm going next, not whether I actually like the lifestyle.

"I'm used to it," I say, which is true without being a complete answer.

"That's not the same thing."

"No," I admit. "I guess it's not."

She waits, like she's giving me space to say more if I want to. When I don't, she doesn't push. Just nods slightly, like I've confirmed something she suspected.

"Well, you're welcome here for however long you're staying. Silver Ridge is a good place. Small, everyone knows everyone's business, but good."

"That's what it seems like."

"First impressions usually hold up." She glances past me and waves at someone. "I should go say hi to Mrs. Henderson before she leaves. I'll see you at the center tomorrow afternoon?"

"I'll be there."

"Good." She smiles again, genuine and warm. "Really nice to meet you, Jesse."

"You too."

She moves away through the crowd, stopping to hug an elderly woman, and I watch her for a moment before catching myself and looking away.

Frank appears at my elbow. "Ready?"

"Yeah."

We make our way out of the community center into the bright June sunshine. The walk back to the house is quiet, Frank not being much for unnecessary conversation. I'm grateful for the silence. It gives me time to process.

Harper Wells.

The minister's daughter who asked if I liked traveling instead of just where I'd been. Who welcomed me without wariness, treated me like a person instead of a stranger to be suspicious of.

I don't know what to do with that.

Most people in new towns keep me at arm's length until I prove myself. It's easier that way. No expectations, no disappointments. Harper's immediate warmth is disarming.

"Harper's a good kid," Frank says suddenly, breaking the silence. "Known her since she was in pigtails. Whole family's good people."

"Seems like it."

"Reverend and Mrs. Wells have high standards for who their daughter spends time with. They're protective."

I glance at him. "I'm just helping at the center."

"I know. Just making sure you know." Frank's expression doesn't change. "You're leaving come September."

"That's right."

"Good to keep that in mind."

We walk the rest of the way in silence, and I understand what Frank's not saying directly: Harper Wells isn't for me. She's the minister's daughter in a town where she's known and loved, destined for some local boy who'll give her the stable life her parents want. I'm just passing through, a drifter with no roots and no plans beyond the next town.

I already knew that, of course.

Doesn't explain why I spent half the church service noticing the way she sang hymns, or why her genuine welcome felt like something I didn't know I'd been missing, or why the thought of seeing her tomorrow afternoon at the community center creates a small knot of anticipation in my chest that I immediately try to ignore.

She's temporary. This whole town is temporary.

Three months, then I'm gone.

I need to remember that.
